Arrow Based Moses Training Pipeline
===================================

This demonstration implements a training pipeline that is shown in the Dia diagram in documentation/training-pipeline/moses-pypeline.dia.

The demo has been tested with:

 - Moses v1.0
 - Giza++ v1.0.7
 - IRSTLM v5.70.04


Setup
-----

To use the demonstration you must first initialise the git submodules for this clone. Return to the top level directory and issue the following command:

$ git submodule update --init --recursive

This will clone PCL, available at Github (git://github.com/ianj-als/pcl.git), and Pypeline submodules, available at GitHub (git://github.com/ianj-als/pypeline.git).

Return to the arrow-pipelines contrib directory:

$ cd contrib/arrow-pipelines

To use the PCL compiler and run-time set the following environment variables (assuming Bash shell):

$ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/python/pcl/src/pclc:`pwd`/python/pcl/src/pcl-run
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`/python/pcl/libs/pypeline/src
$ export PCL_IMPORT_PATH=`pwd`/python/pcl/src/runtime:`pwd`/pcl

Three environment variables need to be set before the pipeline can be run, they are:

 - MOSES_HOME : The directory where Moses has been cloned, or installed,
 - IRSTLM : The installation directory of your IRSTLM, and
 - GIZA_HOME : The installation directory of GIZA++.


Building the example training pipeline
--------------------------------------

$ cd pcl
$ make


Running the example training pipeline
-------------------------------------

To execute the training pipeline run the following command:

$ pcl-run.py training_pipeline

Once complete the output of the pipeline can be found in the directories:

 - training/tokenisation
 - training/model
 - training/lm
 - training/mert
