Statement by the President
You all deserved your holiday .
You all look well-rested and I hope that you are now looking forward very much to getting back to our work on European matters .
I am afraid that I have to start with some sad news .
Since we last met here , we have learned with deep sadness of the deaths of two great Europeans , Gaston Thorn and Raymond Barre , both eminent men who dedicated themselves to the service of their countries as outstanding Prime Ministers and Members of the European Commission .
Gaston Thorn was a Member of the European Parliament for ten years , from 1959 to 1969 .
From 1969 to 1974 , he was Luxembourg 's Minister for Foreign Affairs and then became that country 's Prime Minister in 1974 , holding office until 1979 .
He served as President of the European Commission from 1981 until 1985 .
Under his guidance , the European Community negotiated the terms for the accession of Spain and Portugal , initiated the common fisheries policy and reached a solution to the contentious issues surrounding the Community 's budgetary resources and its future financing .
Raymond Barre was the Vice-President of the European Commission from 1967 to 1973 and Prime Minister of France from 1976 to 1981 .
As Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs , he presented the initial proposals for the creation of a European economic and monetary union within the framework of the Barre Plan in 1969 and 1970 .
Both men worked tirelessly on European integration until the end of their lives , making extremely important and practical contributions in support of this process under what , at that time , were often very difficult conditions .
Last weekend , Altiero Spinelli would have celebrated his 100th birthday .
As one of the architects of the present European institutions , Altiero Spinelli was a Member of this Parliament for ten years .
I had the great honour of working with him for seven of those ten years until his death in 1986 .
During his ten years as a Member of the European Parliament , and especially as the Chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs , he played a key role in pushing forward an ambitious agenda for institutional reform .
His draft Treaty establishing the European Union , which the European Parliament adopted by a substantial majority in 1984 , created the basis for many of the important changes introduced by subsequent Treaty reforms , including a substantial expansion of the European Parliament 's legislative powers .
During the summer recess , we witnessed a whole series of natural disasters : from the dramatic floods in the United Kingdom to the heat wave in the eastern Mediterranean and the recent tragic fires in Greece .
These events have inflicted great suffering on many people in Europe .
In Greece , more than 60 people died as a result of the major fires .
It is entirely appropriate that this tragedy should be the first important item on our agenda this afternoon , and I am sure that I speak for everyone in this House in expressing our most heartfelt condolences to the victims of these and other tragic events .
Our sympathy also goes out to the relatives of the more than 500 people who died in the earthquake in Peru on 15 August and to the thousands who , since we last met , have lost their lives in the senseless violence in Iraq .
The plight of the countless refugees still dying as they attempt to cross the Mediterranean and the Atlantic by boat in order to reach the European Union also causes us sorrow and concern .
It remains incumbent on all of us to find solutions to bring these tragedies to an end .
I would ask you to rise for a minute 's silence in remembrance of the dead .

One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance pursuant to Rule 144 .
( BG ) Mr. Chairman , colleagues ,
The natural disasters we witnessed in Europe this year come to prove the need for two substantial changes in the way in which we tackle these problems .
In the first place , there is a need for the establishment of more flexible mechanisms to assist countries in the process of recovery after natural disasters .
Secondly , these problems reveal the need for the establishment of integrated European rapid response forces to supplement the capacity of nations facing such disasters .
This year , my country Bulgaria suffered from both fires and floods .
When massive fires had to be extinguished around one of the big cities , Stara Zagora , the government requested help from the Member States of the European Union but could not receive it because their capacity was busy .
Instead , it received support from Russia on the basis of a bilateral agreement .
That badly affected the image of the European Union in my country .
Therefore I am asking all of you to appeal to the European Commission to make a thorough analysis and draft proposals for the establishment of joint European forces to assist the Member States in their response to disasters and accidents .
Thank you .
Mr President , international terrorism represents the dark side of globalisation .
Terrorists abuse the democratic freedoms granted by our countries , such as free travel , media coverage and citizens ' rights , to attain their aims through fear and violence against innocent people .
Addressing this problem calls for an effort to fully uncover and understand the intimate mechanisms of terrorism , including its religious , societal and even civilisational roots .
We in the democratic states start with a handicap in this area .
While we strive to save lives , terrorists want to cause as many casualties as possible in the hope of being able to manipulate the emotion generated by the images of carnage shown on our television sets .
We need to distinguish between the suicide bomber and his or her recruiter .
Very often , the suicide bomber is not driven by the hate which characterises his or her recruiter , but by the promise of perpetual happiness after an heroic death , which is politically exploited by the recruiter .
Prevention is better than having to react .
To that effect , we need to strike the right balance between the immediate and longer-term requirements of the fight against terrorism .
We therefore need to strengthen intelligence , police and judicial cooperation between our states while simultaneously addressing the structural causes of terrorism , especially in the countries providing the most recruits for such acts .
( RO ) Mr President , after tens of years of political imprisonment the members of the Ilaşcu group in the Republic of Moldova have recently been invited to the European Parliament and were heard by the Sub-Commission on Human Rights .
Adrian Ivanţoc , Tudor Petru Popa and Alexandru Leşko spoke tearfully about the torture they endured in the Transnistrian prisons , and about the repeated abuses and violations of human rights that occurred there .
They called on the European Community to take more action , to solve the regional conflict with a view to implementing all international agreements , especially those providing for the retreat of Russian troops from Transnistria .
In order to turn these legitimate wishes into reality , the European Parliament should rally and also rely on the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights when it proposes actual measures to support NGOs in Moldova , should encourage and support the publishing of newspapers and magazines in this area and should build a broadcasting network on the right bank of the Nistru in order to ensure that Moldavian national radio and TV channels can be received .
Last but not least , there is a desire to radically change how the Transnistrian problem is being negotiated .
The European Union , and also Romania , as a member of the Union , must change the status of observers to full member status .
( PL ) Mr President , a few months ago the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning xenophobia and burgeoning nationalism in Europe .
The treatment meted out in that document to certain countries , including Poland , was unduly harsh and out of all proportion to the scale of the problem .
Of course issues relating to racial hatred must be treated very seriously indeed .
That is why I am surprised that the European Commission is not taking decisive action against parties of a fascist nature that are in the ascendant in some countries .
There are even countries where representatives of such parties hold elected office at regional level .
Hit squads from those parties are abusing foreigners on the streets and making public appeals for borders to be revised .
This is a serious problem mainly affecting a number of countries of the so-called old Union .
The countries concerned should have dealt with the problem long since , yet the Community 's leaders are pointing the finger at the new Member States even in the case of insignificant incidents .
- ( ES ) Mr President , on 12 August there was a collision in the Strait of Gibraltar between the New Flame cargo vessel and the Torm Gertrud oil tanker .
This is the ninth accident in one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes , used by over 100 000 vessels per year .
The accident points to the pressing need to create a supervision and monitoring port authority between the Kingdom of Spain , the United Kingdom and Gibraltar .
The fact that this kind of shipping control does not exist puts lives in jeopardy and logically constitutes a threat to the local environment .
To date we still do not know , and I feel the European Commission should demand to know , what the sunken cargo ship is carrying : 27 000 tonnes of scrap metal , possibly hazardous , contaminated scrap .
I feel it is most important that Parliament and the European Commission urge the authorities in Spain State , the United Kingdom and Gibraltar to create this shipping supervision and monitoring body .
Mr President , I wish to draw attention to an innovation in European marine conservation .
On Saturday , Scotland became the first country in Europe to implement a voluntary scheme of real-time closures of fishing grounds , with the aim of safeguarding cod stocks .
That scheme , which was developed as a joint initiative between the new Scottish Government and the fishing industry , will hopefully provide a template for future marine conservation projects .
I understand that the Scottish Government has engaged with its counterparts in Denmark and Norway with a view to learning from this particular project .
The common fisheries policy has been nothing but a disaster for Scotland to date , and I firmly believe that the future of fisheries management lies not in central control from Brussels but in direct cooperation between fishing nations .
The Scottish Government and the industry are to be commended for taking such an innovative approach on this matter .
I hope , in the mean time , that when it comes to the December Council their voluntary efforts will be taken into account , recognised and rewarded .
( PL ) Mr President , the Nazi invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 was yet another act of violence perpetrated against my homeland .
More than six million Poles perished during the ensuing six years of war .
This represented 17 % of Poland 's population , which amounted to 35 million individuals at the time .
Two weeks later , on 17 September 1939 , the Soviet Union also attacked Poland pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact .
Over 22 000 of Poland 's intellectual elite lost their lives , shot in the back of the head by the Soviets who then occupied my homeland for many long years .
This explains why millions of my countrymen were so full of hope when we regained our independence .
Despite many fine words and Union slogans about equal rights and non-discrimination , however , certain German politicians and sections of the German media are constantly attacking my homeland , the people of Poland , the Government of Poland and the Catholic media , notably Radio Maryja .
This proves that aggressive anti-Polish sentiment still persists .
On the anniversary of the invasion of Poland and on behalf of the living and the dead , I call for an end to this violence , which could be construed as an attempt to achieve objectives it proved impossible to attain through war .
Thank you .
Reconciliation always remains an important task in Europe .
( RO ) Mr President , my intervention concerns the rights of the Romanians in Serbia and Bulgaria .
The territory on the right bank of the Danube , in North-Western Serbia and North-Western Bulgaria , including , the area from the Ratan Mountains to the Danube , and from Moravia Valley to Timoc Valley in Serbia , and the Vidin region until Lom in Bulgaria , , is primarily populated by Romanians .
They form a minority of over 300 000 people , living in more than 130 small and middle-sized villages and 20 towns .
They are not recognized as a national minority , they do not benefit from religious services and education in their mother tongue .
Romanian is not taught in their schools .
The Romanian language , literature and history are studied under semi-clandestine conditions , in private homes .
The sole Romanian church in Mălăiniţa will soon be demolished .
The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia has drawn attention to the desperate situation of the Romanian people living there , and to their right to preserve their national identity .
I hereby call upon the European institutions to urgently investigate this situation and to intervene for the Romanian minority 's rights in Serbia and Bulgaria to be respected .
( RO ) Mr President , Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union defines terrorism as a serious crime .
In the Treaty on the European Union , actions whose effects endanger people 's lives , which promote violence and aim to intimidate the population qualify as terrorist offences .
What we have seen in Budapest with the establishment of the Hungarian Guard can be included within the scope of this definition .
On that occasion , the leader of the Hungarian Guard made some fairly shocking declarations , expressing his concerns regarding Slovakia and Romania , two countries with Hungarian communities , that could attack Hungary .
I think that such organisations and extremist actions encourage separatist movement within the minorities that have already autonomous trends and such a situation is not in accordance with the proper conduct of an EU Member State .
Such organisations should be dissolved and attitudes similar to those expressed by the Hungarian Guard should be forbidden and punished by law .
Therefore , I take the liberty of calling on the leaders of the EU institutions to firmly condemn such attitudes and to ask the Agency for Fundamental Rights to draw up a report on the facts and to monitor the situation faced by the minorities living in Hungary .
( FR ) Mr President , in our various countries many dramatic situations bring us back to our European obligations .
Such is the case in my country , where a cargo vessel has caused the death of a fisherman .
This leads us on to maritime safety , and now the French know where the Republic of the Kiribati Islands is .
I would urge you to have a look at the atlas : it is not very well known , but this is a flag of convenience .
The European Union must in all urgency get tough on flags of convenience , speed up legislation in the Erika III package , invent an ' Erika IV ' package on the social matter of sailors ' training and working conditions , and simultaneously arrange better coordination for action by our countries in the International Maritime Organisation .
This is an old issue that rears its head at frequent intervals , but many dramas bring us back to it .
I urge you , Commissioner , and the gentleman or lady representing the Council not in attendance , to step up your efforts in this direction .
( RO ) Mr President , on 18October 2007 , the European Commission will launch the EU Anti-Trafficking Day .
I would like to welcome this initiative which will bring this sensitive and -for the most part- unknown issue to the attention of the European citizens , with around 2 and a half million victims every year .
Therefore , I would like to draw the attention once again to the fact that in order to have successful results in the fight against this phenomenon , Member States should coordinate their efforts more efficiently .
Currently , national laws do not allow this .
Yet Member States have available to them the 2005 European Council Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings , which represents the most comprehensive legal instrument for fighting this phenomenon .
However , until now , only 18 of the 27 Member States have signed up to this Convention and only 3 Member States have ratified it .
That is why , I am taking the liberty in asking the European Commission to request the power to sign the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings on behalf of the European Communities from the Council .
Mr President , trafficking in human beings is a serious breach of human rights .
We now have to move from words to deeds .
It is time to act in order to make it easier to punish traffickers , and to protect victims ' rights .
These victims are sold and resold , treated as slaves in a modern Europe ; a Europe about which we are proud to say is based on respect for human rights .
( PL ) Mr President , I should like to begin by expressing my sincere condolences to the relatives of all the victims of the natural disasters in Greece and in other countries .
My heart bleeds for them .
I was myself affected by a disastrous flood 10 years ago , so I am very well aware of what is involved .
Unfortunately , disasters will continue to happen .
The establishment of a European Rapid Reaction Force is therefore particularly necessary .
I strongly support the creation of such a force at the earliest opportunity .
It is strange that we express practically no opposition to the establishment of a whole series of European agencies , even though there are now several dozen bureaucratic entities of that type .
When peoples ' lives are at stake , however , we always express countless reservations .
It is time to overcome the latter and set up European units modelled on the UN 's so-called blue berets but wearing perhaps red or white ones instead .
These units would be tasked with protecting us against the continuing threatening onslaughts of nature rather than against human beings .
( HU ) Life has rapidly proven the truth of the professionally-based arguments with which I , along with my colleagues in the European Parliament , have fought against the European Commission and its decision to end the maize intervention .
The Commission was concerned that the intervention system could not be maintained because of the surplus in maize , though market trends did not indicate this .
The Commission purchased at EUR 101 , and it is now selling for twice that and so is profiteering considerably from the entire maize intervention , while drought has struck Europe and livestock farmers have been short of grain .
This raises questions about the trustworthiness of the Union : there is still available stock , but multinational speculators are buying up supplies while honest livestock farmers are not able to get sufficient fodder for their animals .
This undermines trust in the European Commission and the European Union .
Mr President , dear colleagues , the Romanian Government decided that 25 November 2007 would be the date for European Parliament elections .
On that day we will assist in what is an historical moment , one could say .
Romanian citizens will be able to directly vote for MEPs .
That day will be a test of our seriousness and of our commitments to being an EU Member State .
In Romania , the election campaign will be a chance to hold discussions on interesting issues concerning the European Union : the future of the EU , the Constitutional Treaty , the next enlargement , internal reform , the efficiency of the European institutions , free access to the labour market .
These should be the issues debated during the election campaign and not politicised issues , that are not included in the citizen 's day-to-day agenda : anticipated elections , motion of non-confidence , unfounded political attacks .
In order to improve the quality of the debates during the pre-election period and the election campaign , I hereby call upon experienced MEPs , irrespective of their political views , to visit Romania during the period before the elections to include on the agenda for the European Parliament campaign those European issues that must be debated in a consistent and serious manner both in Romania and in the other European countries .
( FR ) Mr President , I wish to inform you of the trial currently being held in Agrigente , Sicily of seven Tunisian fishermen accused of aiding illegal immigration , even though on 8 August they rescued 44 people , including 11 women , two of whom were pregnant , and two children .
They are now accused of aiding illegal immigration , and this is happening on European soil .
I feel that the crime of solidarity that is now taking place , as this trial demonstrates , ought to be condemned by Parliament .
A delegation is also due to travel to Agrigente this Friday , and I can only encourage the Members and their leader , you , Mr President , to voice their support for these seven Tunisian fishermen .
Mr President , this week the Freedom Drivers return to Parliament .
The Freedom Drivers are people with disabilities and high dependency needs , who want to enjoy the same freedom of movement that everyone else enjoys and that Europe represents .
They come to ask for the kind of legislation that will allow them this freedom of movement .
They will explain the obstacles they face .
Many of these obstacles are of our making and removing them should be a challenge for this Parliament , for the nations and the people we represent .
My challenge to you , Commissioner , is that this is their third year visiting and little has changed .
Yes , we have improved air passenger rights , but we have little else to say to them .
When can we expect the long-awaited disability directive that will put real legislative weight behind equality for people with disabilities ?
( SK ) Prior to joining the Union , some people in Central Europe thought that membership of the Union would solve all our problems .
That has not happened .
Although the Union was created to safeguard peace in Europe , I must highlight the radicalisation of the situation in Hungary .
Members of the so-called ' Hungarian Guard ' took the oath a few days ago .
Its leaders talk about a common border for all Hungarians and its Memorandum of Association talks about compulsory weapons training .
They wear uniforms and enjoy the support of a former government minister .
Slovak-Hungarian relations have deteriorated recently .
A few months ago the Hungarian Prime Minister refused to meet his Slovak counterpart and there is renewed talk about the revision of the outcome of World War II .
I call on the Hungarian Government to take action against the paramilitary guard and dissolve it .
We Slovaks have outlawed a similar radical organisation in our country .
There is no place for anything of this kind in the Europe of the 21st century .
Reconciliation and mutual apology are in our common interest : Slovak and Hungarian Catholic bishops led by example in Ostrihom last year .
That is what saying ' no ' to extremism looks like in practice .
Mr President , my colleagues and I recently witnessed a very strange phenomenon at Terminal 1B of Frankfurt Airport .
Passengers leaving for Sofia on a Bulgaria Air flight had to go through two consecutive security checks that were completely identical .
After enquiring of the terminal officials why passengers had to stand twice in a long queue to undergo the same security check procedures , I received the absurd explanation that Frankfurt Airport was overloaded and second checks were required because of extra passengers arriving from elsewhere .
A reliable source later informed me that these double checks are applied on certain days of the week at Terminal 1B for flights to the following EU countries : Bulgaria , Poland and Romania .
Mr President , I would expect the Commission to respond to this practice because it has to do not just with air passengers ' rights but also with the human rights of European citizens .
( RO ) In the Accession Treaty to the European Union , Romania undertook to organise elections for the European Parliament by the end of this year .
The Romanian Government unfortunately postponed the initial date for the European Parliament elections , that is 13 May , until 25 November .
Analysts say that the main reason for this postponement was fear of certain political parties , including the governing parties , concerning the outcome of these elections .
An old Romanian proverb says " you can run but you cannot hide ” .
The Romanian Government is afraid not only of these elections but also , unfortunately , is afraid of women .
There is no woman in the Government and this is something particular in the EU Member States .
Among the current 35 Romanian MEPs , 12 are women .
After the November elections , the political parties should be able to change the gender ratio and they should designate at least 18 women in the European Parliament .
I would like to assure you that the Democrat Party -as a member of the European Popular Party- will act in this way .
Therefore , I would like to remind the Romanian Prime Minister that Romania is part of the European Union as of 1 January and that 2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All .
( PL ) Mr President , last Friday Polish trade union members from the Gdansk shipyard demonstrated in front of the European Commission 's headquarters in Brussels .
In July the European Commission issued an ultimatum , giving Poland one month in which to submit plans to reduce the shipyard 's production capacity .
The Commission is calling for the closure of two of the three slipways at Gdansk , if the shipyard is not to be required to return the State aid it has received from the Government of Poland since 1 May 2004 .
The EU Commissioners claim that the Commission 's intention is to modernise the shipyard , not close it .
In fact , such a drastic reduction of production capacity with the closure of two out of the three slipways would make the facility unprofitable .
In practical terms , it would result in the loss of a great many jobs and ultimately in the collapse of the shipyard .
The Gdańsk shipyard is not , however , simply an ordinary shipbuilding facility employing a great many workers .
It is also one of the most important symbols of the contemporary history of Poland and of our united Europe , namely the birthplace of the Solidarity movement .
The European Parliament ought to urge the European Commission to seek an appropriate solution to this situation , one that would give priority to the good of the facility and of its workers .
In our role as the voice of European society we should express our solidarity with the shipyard 's workers , and insist on a solution ensuring both the shipyard 's stability and respect for this symbol of the history of contemporary Europe .
Mr President , how much does membership of the European Union cost Britain ?
Last week I published my second annual report on that very subject .
By calculating the direct and indirect costs , I established that EU membership costs Britain at least GBP 60.1 billion per annum gross , or GBP 50.6 billion per annum net .
That equates to over GBP 1 000 gross , or GBP 843 net , for every man , woman and child in the UK .
Put another way , that is GBP 114 000 per minute gross or GBP 96 000 per minute net .
The majority of the British people realise that this is a colossal waste of money .
It is no wonder that UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is refusing to give the British people a referendum on the new reform treaty .
If he thinks that the EU is value for money , he should accept my challenge and commission an independent cost-benefit analysis to prove it .
That would be the prudent thing to do .
( SK ) The prefab blocks of flats in the V4 countries and in Bulgaria and Romania were built 40 years ago and are in need of renovation .
It is not possible to get money from the Structural Funds because of the de minimis rule .
Under this condition , without the approval of the European Commission , a single beneficiary is not allowed to receive from the State a grant exceeding EUR 200 000 ( approximately 6.8 million Slovak crowns ) over a three-year period .
The prefab estates are managed by only a few groups , housing cooperatives or administrators .
The average cost of renovation is 580 000 Slovak crowns for one prefab house and approximately EUR 17 000 for one flat .
The new Member States would benefit if the Commission did not apply the de minimis rule in certain instances .
At the end of June the ministers of these countries agreed to set up a group of experts , which will be involved in talks with the Commission .
Its task will be to harmonise the legislation with the conditions for receiving EU financing for the renovation of prefab housing under the Structural Funds .
Prefab houses are the main urban renovation problem in the new EU Member States .
Since they are in a state of serious disrepair , I am asking the European Commission and you , my fellow Members , to support this initiative .
Mr President , I should like to draw the attention of the House to the tragic fire at the Penhallow Hotel on the seafront of Newquay , Cornwall , in my constituency .
Three people died in the fire : one because he jumped from a high window , and two - one of whom is rumoured to have been disabled - died in their rooms .
These people would probably not have died if they had lived elsewhere in the European Union .
In Hungary , for example , a hotel of this height would have been required to have had sprinklers fitted .
In the last four years , 60 people in Europe have died in fires in hotels where no sprinklers were fitted ; no one in Europe has died in a fire in a hotel where sprinklers have been fitted .
I ask the Commission to take this fact into account and to bring forward proposals in terms of fire safety legislation for hotels across the Union .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during the last parliamentary term our Radical Party colleague , Maurizio Turco , asked the European Commission some questions about the tax privileges of the Catholic Church and companies revolving around it in Italy and Spain .
The Commission 's answers to the request for information reached Italy just a couple of weeks ago .
In Spain the questions led to VAT legislation being amended in such a way as to do away with those advantages and privileges .
In Italy , on the other hand , a series of absolutely unseemly reactions ensued : some people , including former minister Maurizio Gasparri , went so far as to speak of Bin Laden-style actions , while others have talked about anticlerical racism .
Even the Vice-President of the European Parliament , Mr Mauro , has referred to the anti-Catholic and antisocial arm of the Radical Party Minister , Mrs Bonino .
In my opinion , this House should be pleased if for once questions to the European Commission have had such a tangible effect , and I believe that we should continue our support for this initiative .
- ( NL ) Mr President , you may know that a peaceful demonstration against the Islamisation of Europe was due to have taken place on 11 September in Brussels .
Citizens from several Member States wanted to organise this action and the demonstration aimed first and foremost to appeal to the European institutions in general and to Parliament in particular .
That is why the appointed place was Luxemburgplein right next to the entrance to Parliament .
Now , however , the socialist Mayor of Brussels has banned this demonstration outright .
This makes a mockery of freedom of expression and the right of free assembly .
This is not so much an internal matter for Brussels or Belgium , but a matter that concerns us as Parliament and it would therefore be proper for you to register a protest against the ban on this demonstration in Brussels .
It cannot be that we in Europe promote basic democratic rights all over the world through the European institutions , while in Brussels , in the heart of the European Union , these same basic rights are being trodden underfoot .
Mr President , I rise with great regret because I have considerable admiration and respect for you .
However , I want to protest at the fact that last week , in the Parliament building in Brussels , there was a conference allowed , which was ostensibly dedicated to peace in the Middle East but which in fact transpired to be a one-sided , prejudiced , biased , unrepresentative attack on the State of Israel .
I am afraid it was in sharp contrast to what is actually happening in the region , where very patient negotiations between the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority are moving forward under American auspices .
This conference , as you know , was not a conference of the European Parliament .
It took place in the Parliament building and it allowed the organisers to gain credit and our approval for what they said .
You were thanked personally for facilitating that conference .
I think we should reflect carefully before we do that again .
The European Parliament building is not a meeting house for every group that wants to have a protest at this or that problem throughout the world .
It certainly should not be allowed to be hijacked by those extremists who will never recognise that peace in the Middle East , as elsewhere , will only come by negotiation and not by the bullet and the bomb .
Mr Sumberg , since you addressed the President of Parliament , I should like first to thank you for your appreciative comments .
However , I must make it clear that there are things that are not part of the competence of the President .
This was a decision of the Conference of Presidents and , therefore , I had to carry it out .
The conference was organised by an institution of the United Nations .
Therefore , it was not any institution but rather an institution of the UN .
I explained this in a formal letter to the Speaker of the Knesset and I have also explained it to the Ambassador .
As far as the President of the European Parliament is concerned , I did not take part in it and I did not receive any of the speakers .
The conference was held in the European Parliament , but the European Parliament was not responsible for it .
I think you should take that into consideration .
( DE ) I must now remind you , however , that the President , who always tries to accommodate the Members of this House , is now invoking Rule 144 .
This states that the President may call Members for a period of not more than thirty minutes .
I have always assumed that this was the minimum , which is why I have always been generous in my interpretation of this provision .
It means that Mr Sumberg , to my regret , is now the last Member to be called .
However , I hope that my answer to him has been informative and has explained the situation regarding this event more fully .
That concludes the item .
Forest fires in Greece , their consequences and conclusions to be drawn for prevention and preparedness measures ( debate )
The next item is the statement by the Commission on forest fires in Greece , their consequences and conclusions to be drawn for prevention and preparedness measures .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , I first wish to apologise for the absence of my colleague Stravros Dimas , who wished to take part in this debate but has been prevented from doing so due to a recent serious eye operation .
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Commission wishes to express its deepest regret following the devastation caused by the forest fires in Greece .
Our thoughts are with the victims and their families .
President Barroso travelled to Greece this weekend to size up the situation for himself .
Commissioner Hübner also visited the scene in order to assess to what extent European funds can make a contribution to reconstruction work there , and will report on her visit at tomorrow 's College meeting .
Commissioner Dimas , who was in Greece during the initial fires , witnessed the deployment of international assistance for the Greek fire-fighters , and also reported to the College in order to inform the entire Commission about the aid provided and to appeal for all available instruments to be mobilised for rapid reconstruction .
This has been both a human tragedy and an ecological disaster .
The fires have destroyed human lives , homes and the economic framework of an entire nation .
The extent of the damage is considerable : at least 180 000 hectares of land have been burned , and 130 towns and villages devastated .
In the areas most seriously affected , such as the Peloponnese and central and eastern Greece , regional economies were badly hit .
All Europeans were moved by footage of the fires , and Europe was prompted to react and take measures when Greece called for assistance .
The Commission 's Monitoring and Information Centre was able to coordinate the assistance offered by 14 Member States , and the international community provided additional fire-fighting assistance , thereby playing a major role in preventing the fires from spreading .
With the assistance of the Commission , Greece 's European partners were able to supply specialist airborne assistance with 13 Canadair water bombers and 20 helicopters - this information will be updated on Monday - and fire-fighting units on the ground , vehicles and other facilities .
Particularly valuable assistance was provided by Norway , Switzerland , Serbia , Russia and Israel .
The mission was the largest ever European civil protection operation carried out for a Member State .
Aid was rapid and efficient , a remarkable example of European solidarity .
The damage caused by the fires in Greece was on an exceptional scale , and occurred within a general context of escalation of this type of disaster .
Between July and August this year the Commission received a dozen international assistance calls : from Greece , Cyprus , Italy , Bulgaria , Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
As a general rule the response by Member States was generous and immediate .
The increase in the number of calls for assistance , however , brought about a situation which eventually affected the operational limitations of airborne fire-fighting operations .
The European Union ought to give first priority to the possibility of mobilising additional capacity , and equip itself with extra fire-fighting facilities by approaching either non-EU countries or the private sector .
The Greek Government has estimated the damage at approximately EUR 4 billion , or around 2 % of Greek GDP .
The government is drawing up a coherent action plan to redress the situation , and has informed the Commission that it intends to seek assistance from available EU programmes .
The terrible environmental damage caused in Greece is now compounded by the risk of torrential rain running into rivers to hit a weakened ecosystem , and soil erosion causing landslides and water pollution .
A large number of protected zones have been destroyed , and the Commission is now examining how the available funds , and the Life + Fund in particular , could be mobilised to help restore the habitats destroyed .
The Commissioners have discussed these issues in detail and the Commission has undertaken to take all possible measures to help the Greek Government to cope with the social , environmental and economic consequences of the fires .
One possible instrument available to meet the needs of the Greek people is a reprogramming of the Structural Funds for the regions and programmes directly affected .
Moreover , the Solidarity Fund may be mobilised on the basis of a request submitted by the Greek authorities .
Within this context , the cooperation of Parliament and the Council will be essential to reduce as far as possible the length of the process for the adoption of an amending budget proposed by the Commission with a view to mobilising this Fund .
In relation to the support envisaged by the 2006 operational programmes concerned , as soon as a request for modification is made by the Greek authorities the Commission will examine it with maximum flexibility within the context of the existing regulatory provisions .
Any available credits will be diverted towards meeting the immediate needs of the people and regions affected by the crisis .
A fast-track procedure will be used by the Commission to ensure a rapid decision .
For the period 2007-2013 , the Commission will adopt new programmes as planned in October following the request by the Greek authorities .
The programmes may be adopted at a later date depending on the needs identified and the regions and sectors concerned , on the basis of an overall plan presented by the Greek authorities .
With respect to the European Social Fund , we must ask the Greek authorities to include a substantial ' human resources ' section in the ongoing action plan .
The plan must cover all areas : employment , inclusion and health , education and training , and public administration reform .
Climate change may bring drier winters and hotter summers , thereby creating an ideal context for fires .
There is now an increasing risk of forest fires , and Europe 's response to this tragedy must also take account of the need to reduce the impact of future fires .
Forest management is largely the responsibility of the Member States .
This is understandable since the national governments are in a better position to administer their own territory , invest in fire prevention measures and plan the responses of the emergency services .
There are also many options whereby the EU may provide back-up for national responses in this area .
The Commission intends to draw up a communication on forest fires , and will be examining a number of practical measures that could improve fire prevention and the rebuilding of economies and ecosystems .
Even though the EU response in terms of civil protection was impressive , the Commission feels that it is time to enhance its capacity in this area .
This is an aspect it has been considering since 2006 , and in fact President Barroso had already asked Michel Barnier to draw up a report on the matter .
We will carefully examine the recommendations of the Barnier Report when the proposals are submitted .
It is encouraging to see that Parliament has always backed ambitious development of European capacity in terms of civil protection .
Nevertheless , to enable new measures to be adopted , the unanimous support of the Member States must be forthcoming , and this has frequently proved difficult .
In 2006 the Commission proposed using Community funds from the Civil Protection Financial Instrument to provide extra civil protection facilities such as airborne fire-fighting units for large-scale fires .
That is point 9 of that day 's resolution almost word for word .
Regrettably a number of Member States do not share this attitude , and the scheme cannot be implemented .
As a result , the Commission urges the Member States to adopt a more ambitious approach when future proposals are submitted to them in this area .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner Špidla has described in detail the major disaster suffered by my country .
The President of the European Commission , Mr Barroso , and Commissioner Hübner have visited Greece and the other regions affected by the disaster .
On behalf of all Greeks , I should like to take this opportunity to thank the European Union , the Member States and other countries for immediately sending specially trained firemen and air support , thereby providing my country with vital assistance in fighting the catastrophic fires .
I should also like to point out that similar catastrophic fires ( although not on the scale suffered in Greece ) have afflicted all the southern European countries that have experienced similar conditions .
Our primary concern now is to look ahead to the next stage , which is already in progress .
The first economic support measures for victims are already proving effective .
Within a few days , most of those entitled to money to meet their immediate needs and to replace their household belongings have received it .
Many homeless people have access to temporary accommodation in mobile homes .
After the conclusion of an agreement between the Greek Government and the European Commission , affected farmers and stockbreeders ( the latter , I hasten to add , having lost more than 73 000 head of cattle in the fires ) are receiving advance payments to compensate for the loss of their crops , livestock capital and equipment .
I should also like to inform the Commissioner that what he has mentioned is already being done : a study and a draft reconstruction plan for all fire-stricken areas are already in progress .
The plan aims rapidly and effectively to cover the immediate human and economic needs of the victims , and also to repair the environmental damage as quickly as possible .
A special part of the plan concerns landscape regeneration at the Olympia archaeological site , which , together with the ancient stadium , museum and other buildings , has been saved through the superhuman efforts of the fire-fighters .
We must acknowledge that the Community Civil Protection Mechanism has granted Greece the single largest amount of assistance it has given out since it was set up in 2001 .
This assistance has shown that the principles of cooperation and solidarity are at the very heart of the European Union .
With the resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow , our aim is for the European Commission to rapidly mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund and secure all the envisaged financial resources to combat the medium- and long-term consequences .
Secondly , a special rapid-response mechanism should be set up for major natural disasters ; in fact some preliminary work has already been carried out in this area .
We also believe - Mr Špidla mentioned this , but please allow me to highlight this point - that the Commission should consider the creation of an independent supplementary force consisting of private fire-fighting aircraft or of European countries which do not face a serious fire risk during the summer months .
This support force could be located in high-risk countries and be ready for action from the summer of 2008 .
I am sure that the EU will stand alongside my country and show in practice that solidarity is the basic principle governing relations between us .
To conclude , I should like to thank you once again for all the support you have hitherto given .
( Applause )
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I had the opportunity to see the disaster and its impacts for myself in Greece at the weekend .
My colleagues and I travelled to some of the affected areas , and I must say that I have never seen such a tragedy in my life .
There are people who , as a result of these fires , lost everything they owned , their homes and possessions , in a matter of minutes .
I spoke to people who had run for their lives , quite literally with only the clothes on their backs .
The situation is critical .
Many people 's livelihoods are at risk , and they need help in the short term .
Commissioner Špidla is thus quite right when he says that we need swift aid and we need unbureaucratic aid .
Speaking on behalf of my Group , when I say that we need swift and unbureaucratic aid , this does not mean - as some Commission officials think - in two or three months ' time .
No , the aid must be provided now , straight away and directly .
People do not need help in two months ' time ; they need it now .
That is why we are asking for resources to be made available directly from the Solidarity Fund , and if any money is left over in the Structural Funds or other budgets , this should be made available as quickly as possible too .
This is not our first debate about disasters .
Time and again over the last ten years , we have sat here and discussed what to do .
This applies not only to Greece ; it also applies to the people in the flooded areas of Great Britain , who were similarly affected this summer , or people who are affected by earthquakes , and indeed any disaster area .
The following point is important : a centralist approach is of no help when we are trying to mitigate the effects of a disaster at local level .
If there are fires around Athens , we need an effective local fire service , not a Disasters Commissioner in Brussels .
That is the key point : disaster management must be organised on a decentralised basis .
The governments of the European Union must therefore establish their own infrastructures in their own countries , based on their own local conditions and within their own jurisdiction .
This infrastructure is needed to take swift and effective action at local level when floods or fires occur .
The European Union must utilise the opportunities at its disposal in order to ensure effective coordination .
There are governments who want to start by doing everything themselves - even though they have missed every opportunity that has presented itself over the last ten years to develop the infrastructure - and then call for others ' assistance far too late , out of misplaced embarrassment or misplaced ambition .
Let us be clear about one thing then : asking for international assistance , ladies and gentlemen in government , is not an admission of failure .
On the contrary , it shows a sense of responsibility and demonstrates an effective management approach .
Governments need to respond in this way much more quickly .
We then need to develop the coordination mechanisms that are essential to enable us to take effective action .
As politicians , we must all be clear on one point : people do not like the State .
Their experience of the State is its role as a regulatory power or tax authority , and we are all well aware that this is only of peripheral interest to citizens .
There is one thing which interests citizens when it comes to the State and central government , however , and that is knowing that the State is there to help people in their hour of need .
If the State is not there to help when it is urgently needed , and if it does not take action when the police are needed or the fire service is needed , citizens never forget .
That should be borne in mind by everyone in a position of responsibility in every country !
What are we actually here to do ?
Our task is to create the parameters to cushion the fundamental risks facing people in their lives .
This must take place at local level .
I must reiterate that point .
In the places I visited , there is no volunteer fire service .
In my country , in the town where I was mayor , we had a volunteer fire service consisting of men and women who give up their free time to protect others from fire .
In the places I visited in Greece , this does not exist .
It would be an act of solidarity , for example , if countries who do have this type of service could work together with the affected communities , e.g. in Greece , and think about setting up this type of scheme , with the European Union providing assistance , funding and equipment to enable these structures to be established .
That should be one of the lessons we learn from these experiences .
Let me make one final comment that I think is very important : I believe that in a situation such as the one facing the people of Greece today , it is very important for them to feel that they are not alone .
That is why I felt it was so important for us , as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , to send out a message to the people there .
Let us say to them : ' All of us - across party lines - know what you are going through ' .
In this situation , there are no ideological differences .
There is no such thing as Christian Democratic or Socialist fire protection !
What there is , however , is solidarity with people in need .
I have one further comment : there will always be people in need - whether as a result of flooding or fire - unless we understand that it is not just about criminal elements .
Yes , I think that arsonists who want to seize a piece of land by destroying the natural environment are nothing but primitive criminals .
They do exist .
Nonetheless , much of what we have experienced in recent years is a consequence of climate change , and we will have to become acclimatised to much more than what we are experiencing now .
It is not enough to tackle the consequences as they occur .
We must also address the causes .
That is why a new climate policy course will also play a key role in helping us to deal more effectively with what we have witnessed in Greece and elsewhere .
( Applause )
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful to Mr Špidla for being here today and making his statement .
I should like to begin by expressing my solidarity with the Greek people in particular , but also with those in other countries and regions , such as Sicily and southern Italy , who have suffered similar disasters .
I would also pay tribute to the self-sacrifice of the fire-fighters and volunteers and , of course , express sympathy for the victims and their families .
I should like to take up the last part of what Mr Schulz said about the importance of preventive measures .
These are a key priority , in my opinion , especially in view of climate change , and I hope we can all convince ourselves that this is a reality and not just a slogan .
It basically results in a worsening of extreme events , which is why we are witnessing heavier rainfall and longer periods of drought .
This is a totally new challenge for our countries .
There is a need for land maintenance geared to practical steps to combat such phenomena , especially forest fires .
The risk of forest fires must be lessened by thinning trees , clearing away anything that could help to propagate a fire and thereby trying to reduce the fire load and the speed at which the flames can spread .
Maintenance is therefore essential , and this must also include watercourses , in case of flooding , so as to increase water retention times .
Here we simply need to examine the plethora of proposals made in the Barnier Report calling for a Community force to tackle natural disasters .
In conclusion , all the indications are that the civil defence sector is one where the EU needs a capacity to act , because some disasters are on a scale too big for individual Member States to tackle .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , first of all , our thoughts are with the families who have lost members , homes and possessions .
Disaster relief must be set in motion extremely quickly .
Society too has lost valuable forests and valuable habitats .
It is important that the long-term aid is granted in a context of sustainable development so that we do not invest money only for it to be burnt up again .
We talk about natural disasters but increasingly it is anthropogenic disasters that are occurring .
We are changing the climate , the result of which is both extreme drought and extreme rainfall .
In some cases the protection of our forests is weak .
In some cases we are cutting back the civil defence which saves us from fires .
If this is to be sustainable in the long term , work on climate change is needed , both legislation and sound protection of habitats .
I would hope that one condition for European support for construction is reforestation and that money is not used cynically to exploit forest fires to introduce construction of new tourist areas or other changes to land-use .
My Green colleagues in Greece have also asked me - unfortunately we do not have any Green MEPs from Greece - to say that we want to stop amendments to Article 24 of the Greek constitution which weaken the protection of forests .
Right now forests need even more protection .
I do not want to criticise or defend the government today .
An election campaign is in progress and some seek to criticise and some seek to defend the government .
But right now we must help Greece and all the other countries affected - we will accept criticism and analysis when the disaster has been dealt with .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , I address the House on behalf of Georgios Karatzaferis , a Greek Member from my group .
He decided to take care of matters in Greece , where 63 citizens have died , 120 villages and small towns have been damaged and millions of trees have been burnt .
The GNP loss may be calculated as 2 % .
It is a disaster , and Greece needs all possible support from the other Member States and the European Institutions .
It seems that EU funds that had been foreseen for the prevention of such disasters have not been used in the proper way .
I therefore ask the Commission to establish a full investigation into what happened to the Community funds set aside for mapping land and preventing fires .
Who is guilty ?
Who are those responsible ? The families of the 63 Greek citizens who died need an answer ; so do we , because we represent taxpayers .
- ( ES ) Mr President , in recent years we have made a sad tradition of the September part-session in Strasbourg as a discussion of natural disasters .
There can be no doubt this is an exceptional time in terms of material damage and lives lost , especially after the terrible fires in Greece , but also in other European regions .
First and foremost , we must declare our solidarity with the Greek authorities , with the Greek people as a whole , but most particularly with the families of those who died , who do not always receive the support they deserve .
European citizens , however , are entitled to demand a little more of their institutions : flexible application of the European Solidarity Fund , certainly , as Commissioner Špidla has explained , which has not always been the case , but also some specific decisions .
We must therefore ask the Council what else has to happen before it dawns on it that work is needed to reform an obsolete fund .
I feel I must remind the House that the European Commission proposal and amendments by the European Parliament were submitted to it over a year ago , and so my group wishes to ask the Portuguese Presidency to seriously consider calling an extraordinary meeting of the Council to this end .
On another point , although still in relation to the passive attitude of the Council , my group wishes to ask the European Commission to submit specific Community proposals concerning civil protection , along the lines of the Barnier Report .
Mr President , my group has played an active role in the negotiations on a joint resolution , and we support it unreservedly .
I am sure that no one will exploit this debate now to meddle in the Greek election campaign because I am sure that we all agree there is nothing more despicable than attempting to extract political gain from human misfortune .
( EL ) Mr President , today we mourn 65 people who died in the flames of the uncontrolled fires in Greece .
We have witnessed the frightful destruction , in a single week , of more than 12 % of Greece 's total forest area , which is Europe 's forest heritage .
At a time of great disaster , those in power should feel not only a sense of grief , but also a sense of responsibility .
Of course , responsibility for the fires does not lie with this House , but as MEPs , we have a responsibility to ensure that Europe releases aid immediately , without bureaucratic obstacles , for the regeneration of the stricken areas .
We also have a responsibility to draw all the necessary conclusions from the problems involved in preventing and controlling these fires , so that Greece and other EU Member States never experience such a tragedy again .
We PASOK MEPs would like to thank all our colleagues in various political parties who have telephoned and sent messages of support to Greek citizens .
We would like to thank Martin Schulz , who immediately visited our country and who , together with Giorgos Papandreou , took steps to communicate the situation and to secure European assistance .
In addition , we would like to thank all the European governments that have sent help , and also the Commission for its coordinating role .
Commissioner , I welcome the commitments you have made today , as requested both by the Socialists and by other political groups .
The Solidarity Fund must finally be reformed so that it can provide real and immediate assistance .
I particularly applaud the fact that the Commission is looking favourably on the proposal to release funds from the Third Community Support Framework .
In the midst of such a tragedy , let us keep a close eye on the money for the victims : it is in danger of being lost through incompetent handling .
Lastly , I totally agree that a rapid-response team should be set up , not to replace the responsibilities of national governments , but to assist them in coping with terrible disasters .
Hope may grow out of disaster , but in order for this to happen , the following requirements must be met :
· firstly , the burnt areas must be transformed into global models of sustainable , dynamic development , with no environmental throwbacks ;
· secondly , there must be mass reforestation ;
· thirdly , there must be no more discussion of declassification of forest land , because this simply plays into the hands of anyone inclined to commit arson ;
· fourthly , illegal building on burnt land should be strictly prohibited ;
· fifthly , the long-awaited creation in Greece itself of an independent Environment Ministry should be put into effect .
What conclusions can we draw ?
This tragedy was not , unfortunately , inevitable .
The Greek Government itself had foreseen it in its recent report to the Commission ; it acknowledged a dangerous lack of coordination between ministries and the absence of prevention plans .
Yet Greece , as the report itself emphasises , had seen a spectacular improvement in the effectiveness of forest protection between 2001 and 2004 .
Nor was the number of simultaneous outbreaks of fire unprecedented .
In 2000 there was a similar number of outbreaks but the outcome was completely different .
The Greek tragedy of 2007 reminds us that there will always be fires , just as there will always be arsonists .
The key requirement , then , is that there should also be strict policies on the prevention and suppression of fires .
We should examine Greece 's problems , not in order to condemn , but to prevent similar disasters in the future .
For the Europe of 2007 , 65 deaths are unacceptable .
( Applause )
Mr President , the recent forest fires in Greece brought devastation to the communities affected .
Dozens of human lives were lost , hundreds of individuals were injured , thousands of animals were killed , whole villages were burned to the ground and thousands of acres of forests were annihilated .
Our condolences and sympathy go to the people of Greece .
For almost 10 days we watched in horror as the fires destroyed life , property and the environment in Greece , and our minds returned to similar catastrophes in Portugal , Italy , Spain and elsewhere in Europe in previous years .
The EU has a duty to ensure that proper compensation measures are implemented swiftly .
It also has a duty to look critically at the reasons why these fires had such a catastrophic effect , to analyse what went wrong in terms of prevention and fire-fighting effectiveness and to draw conclusions that might guide us in the future .
Reports from Greece point towards possible gross failings by successive central governments and local authorities to establish proper measures to prevent and fight forest fires .
It seems that forests were left without adequate anti-fire zones , without functioning emergency water points and reservoirs , without proper plans for fire-fighting or for the orderly evacuation of villages , without up-to-date fire-fighting equipment and without , in some cases , modern training for fire-fighters .
What happened to EU central monitoring as regards the implementation of forest fire prevention policy ?
Was the Commission not aware of the apparent poor state of affairs in Greece , and what measures , if any , were taken to correct the situation ?
Those questions need to be answered urgently and clearly .
However , there is another aspect that should worry us , which is the fact that , according to the Greek Government , there is strong evidence that many fires were caused by organised arsonists .
The fires in Greece have demonstrated the ever-increasing threat of yet another form of terrorism : arson terrorism .
It is a form of terrorism that is far more difficult to deal with , because arson terrorists do not have to go through sophisticated security checks , but simply have to go for a drive in the countryside .
They do not need to use complicated explosive devices : they just need a matchbox .
Therefore , it is high time that we start acting decisively and collectively on ways to counter this new , very catastrophic , form of terrorism in Europe .
In conclusion , it is very important to mention once again our gratitude to all those who fought and risked their lives in the mountains of Evia and the Peloponnese in fighting the catastrophic fires while , at the same time , politicians in Athens were fighting each other on TV shows .
( DE ) Mr President , I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to all those who are grieving for family and friends .
My thoughts are with those who have lost their homes and possessions .
They need our solidarity .
The Greek Government was forced to admit that legislative loopholes and policy failure were partly the cause of the devastating fires .
In an era of climate change , a rejection of regional policy can have such devastating consequences for the natural environment .
This situation now needs to change , including in Greece .
In the reconstruction effort , one priority must be to preserve and restore the natural landscape in order to make the affected regions habitable again and give the people there a new basis for life and thus a future .
Land speculation in every form must be rejected .
It cannot be permitted , and certainly not with the EU 's money !
I would also caution the Commission against amending the Structural Fund regulations at the expense of sustainability and the partnership principle which are enshrined in it .
At this time , that would be the wrong response to the devastating effects of the forest fires in Greece .
( EL ) Mr President , this summer 's catastrophic fires and floods in Greece as well as in Italy , Portugal , Great Britain and other EU countries , are not a bolt from the blue .
Such unprecedented disasters highlight the need to uncover the true causes , to identify those responsible and to halt this ongoing crime against humanity .
We wish to point out the following : by means of a series of reactionary laws and measures , the governments of the Member States have opened the way to the commercialisation of forests and land and , in general , of anything that may be counted as a social good .
The fires that claimed 75 of our fellow human beings and more than 250 000 hectares of forest , and caused enormous losses to thousands of ordinary households , are an unprecedented and heinous political , economic and ecological crime against the people of our country .
We gave a timely warning of the grievous consequences , and we have , alas , been proved most tragically right .
Let me bring to your attention the findings of the 1993 Greek Parliament inter-party committee , which were unanimously approved by an all-party vote .
These findings highlight the uncertain status of ownership , which encourages speculation and illegal occupation of forest land , especially around towns and in coastal areas .
The findings also point to a lack of investment in forestry .
It was proposed that a single body should be set up to deal with forest protection and the creation of a forest register .
What came of all this ?
Absolutely nothing .
The joint resolution by the European parliamentary groups on the Greek forest fires , their consequences and the conclusions to be drawn in terms of preventive measures and early warning overlook the true causes and the anti-popular policy of the European Union and the governments of the Member States .
A complete lack of foresight is evident .
This extremely dangerous , anti-popular policy strengthens the hand of arsonists and rewards land-grabbers .
It damages the environment , causing serious climate change with devastating consequences for mankind .
As long as this anti-popular policy , fuelled by increased capital profits , is allowed to continue , arson will go on destroying forests and land .
There will be further erosion of workers ' rights , and people 's rights in general - at work , in education , in health , culture , sport and the environment .
Even now , monopoly groups in the tourist sector are preparing to feast among the ashes on the charred remains of our fire-ravaged country .
We believe that at the very least the following must be guaranteed for Greece : no change in land use ; immediate general compensation for agricultural produce and damaged agricultural capital ; the rehousing of all rural residents at the State 's expense , through government agencies .
Also of great importance are the immediate implementation of flood protection projects and other basic prevention infrastructures to forestall further tragedies caused by flooding , and the implementation of measures for immediate protection of the environment and historic sites ; the compilation of a forest register ; the creation of a single body to supervise and protect forests ; and the repeal of the anti-forest laws .
( EL ) Mr President , the huge numbers of fires that have ravaged Greece , many of which were caused by arson , in conjunction with high temperatures , prolonged drought and strong winds , have resulted in the loss of lives , destruction of houses and crops , and the loss of thousands of livestock .
Fires have destroyed large areas of very beautiful forest , causing an unprecedented ecological disaster .
One of the key principles on which the European Union is founded is that of solidarity .
Solidarity has been pledged by many Member States , the Commission and other countries , and Greece is grateful to those who have taken swift action against a natural disaster arising from conditions beyond anything we could have imagined .
However , if we want a quick and coordinated show of solidarity , and an effective one at that , we need to set up a Community mechanism for civil protection against natural disasters , especially when their severity completely exceeds all the capacity of local and national protection bodies .
Amongst other things , the joint resolution proposes restructuring and new , flexible rules for the European Solidarity Fund , coordination of preventive action , and also effective help in combating natural disasters .
There is strong support for the establishment of a special European civil protection force to be mobilised in such situations , and always , of course , as a supplement to national action , in accordance with the Barnier proposal .
I should like to believe that a Community mechanism will be set up soon and that the Solidarity Fund will prove to be more effective in the management of disasters and disaster victims .
We must not remain inactive again , and the European Union must not wait for the inevitable occurrence of another disaster in a Member State before returning to this question .
Now is the time to act decisively ; we must cast aside any small-minded , petty political approach to the issue of natural disasters and civil protection .
( DE ) Mr President , we all feel compassion for those who have lost relatives or friends , but also for those who have lost much of what is important to them in their lives on a very personal level .
Yes , we feel sympathy , and yes , it is the European Union 's task to show solidarity .
That is our fundamental principle , and we want to apply it in this instance too , and yes , in this way , we also want to fulfil our responsibility , which we owe to every one of our fellow countries in the European Union .
If we are expected to take on responsibility , however , then we can expect some responsibility in return .
We must ask ourselves : could this have been avoided ?
I am looking in the direction of my fellow Members who have spoken , longstanding Members of this House who have already adopted numerous laws and action programmes .
There are good grounds for saying , yes , it could have been avoided .
Nine years have passed since the European Parliament adopted the Action Programme for Civil Protection , and what is the Programme about , Mr Trakatellis ?
You were involved in its development , as were many others .
The Programme consists of providing assistance promptly , but it is also about providing training and organising information events so that people at local level are taught how to react and get help quickly .
That should , perhaps , have been possible in this instance too , but probably not everyone is proficient enough yet .
What about the ' Forest Focus ' scheme ?
Is forest management actually being taken seriously ?
In those countries of the European Union which are always hot in summer - in other words , all of Southern Europe - are fire lanes envisaged at all ?
Or is that not lucrative enough ?
These are all things which we need to think about .
If we are willing to take on the responsibility that we owe , then we have the right to demand responsibility as well .
What about waste policy ?
We have frequently been told that there are Member States which do not take it very seriously .
We have been told time and again by the European Commission that there are countries which are not complying with the current legislation .
Of course , that means that a thoughtlessly discarded cigarette end can instantly cause a fire .
Yes , we want to show solidarity and provide assistance .
However , what is this reaction force about ?
I have a question for everyone here today who is calling for a European reaction force and perhaps even a European fire service .
Let me ask them this : how many million people in 27 countries are these supposed to serve ?
Almost 500 million ?
These Members are either charmingly naive , straight out of a fairy tale , or they are populist : one or the other .
We should not delude the people out there into believing that the European Union in Brussels - at the Commission or here in this House - could possibly provide enough fire fighters or rescue workers to intervene for us when disasters occur .
We need communication structures , and we must call up helicopters from Germany , Finland and the Czech Republic when they are needed , the very same day .
After all , there is an early warning system for certain events in the food sector .
There , the deadline is 12 hours .
I believe we would want to achieve a faster response time than 12 hours there too .
I believe we should be honest to the people out there and say , yes , we can give money , and yes , we can set up communication structures .
We can try to help , but you need to take responsibility at local level as well , wherever you are , be it Germany , Northern Europe , Southern Europe or anywhere else .
As dreadful as this situation is at the moment , and as much as we feel compassion and must show solidarity , by the day after tomorrow , we must have identified what needs to change .
( EL ) Mr President , the citizens of southern Europe who have suffered from the catastrophic fires have had a very difficult time .
You were all well aware of the drama unfolding in Greece , where many lives were lost and huge areas of forest were burnt .
As well as economic consequences , this disaster has had human and environmental implications .
We should ask ourselves what will happen to all those who lost their homes , work and land .
The Solidarity Fund provides financial aid , but what will be done in social terms to reintegrate the victims ?
Moreover , what will happen to the environment ?
As the first rains will not be slow in coming , further disasters threaten in the middle of winter .
These are the questions we are putting to the Commission , and we must insist , as we did in a similar resolution last year , on the establishment of a European civil protection authority .
( EL ) Mr President , the Greek Government is using all its resources in its struggle against a catastrophe that has struck Greece on a Biblical scale .
However , the scale of the disaster greatly exceeds the country 's capabilities , as Mr Barroso and Mr Schultz have had the opportunity to find out .
At times such as these , European solidarity becomes truly meaningful .
International public opinion is watching and assessing how the European family handles the grave misfortune suffered by one of its members .
I call on Mr Barroso in his absence to make full use of all the resources made available to him by his constitutional status .
These are the steps which must be taken immediately , and I mean ' immediately ' :
· flexible activation of the European Solidarity Fund ;
· implementation of Article 100 ( 2 ) of the Treaty , which provides for additional Community funding in the event of natural disasters ;
· participation by the Commission and the European Environment Agency in the drafting of a strategic plan for regenerating the fire-stricken areas ;
· adaptation of the Third and Fourth Community Support Framework programmes to repair the damage ;
· derogation from the Community rules on agricultural and stock-rearing quotas , state aid , and tax exemptions .
To conclude , we are grateful for the help we have received from the Member States in recent days .
It was truly invaluable .
However , I do not think it eliminates the need to set up a European civil protection force , as proposed by Mr Sarkozy and Mr Karamanlis .
( PT ) Mr President , we all regret what has happened in Greece and the United Kingdom .
We stand as one with the victims and hope that situations such as these will not reoccur .
Unfortunately , as highlighted by the leader of my group , every year at this time the European Parliament adopts a resolution regretting the natural disasters which have occurred during the parliamentary break and proposing measures which are slow to be taken .
We must progress from words to actions so that this situation is not repeated every year , as is currently happening , with ever greater violence and increasing numbers of victims .
All these events lead us to believe that the risks are increasing due to climate change and global warming .
Various documents exist which suggest solutions - reference has already been made today to the Barnier report and other documents presented by Parliament and the Commission - not only to improve the effectiveness of the civil protection mechanism at European level , but also to improve resources at national level .
As for the oft-mentioned costs , it must be stressed that , when tragedy occurs , this must be tackled and the property destroyed must be rebuilt , which all costs money .
It is clearly more costly to cure than to prevent .
Not one of the resolutions adopted by Parliament provides for the creation of maps identifying the areas at risk of fire which must be taken into account in terms of planning and development .
Various penalties must also be introduced , such as not allowing building in burnt areas for 10 or 15 years .
The Member States do have the necessary ability .
I would remind you that in 2003 and 2005 Portugal also had to tackle devastating fires and fortunately has this year been able to help Greece by sending aircraft to fight the fires there .
We must therefore increase coordination at European level and improve the mechanisms at national level .
It would be desirable for the Commission to present a directive on fires , as it has done on flooding .
I must end by wishing Commissioner Dimas a speedy recovery .
( EL ) Mr President , today I have returned from the disaster-stricken Peloponnese .
I went to visit my birthplace , Messinia , which has been severely stricken by the worst forest fires in a century .
It was not just a fire or a single front .
Hundreds of fires broke out simultaneously , everywhere , throughout the day and night , and in all directions .
I saw villages burning , forests and crops consumed by flames : the elderly preferred to burn in their homes rather than abandon them , and firemen heroically sacrificed their lives in the line of duty .
A total of 65 people died like martyrs , most of them struggling to save their homes and villages .
More than 250 000 hectares were burnt down .
Tens of thousands of residents were left homeless and the whole population is in shock .
On behalf of these people , I beg you for assistance and solidarity .
Give them the hope that will allow them to stand on their own two feet again .
I would like to thank the European Parliament and the Commission , which have accepted a set of important proposals from the Greek Government .
I would like to thank you personally and on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , of which I am a member .
Tomorrow I shall submit further relevant proposals and amendments .
The Europe we are building signifies both solidarity and self-confidence .
Our stricken fellow human beings now need the solidarity and self-confidence that the European Union can offer them .
We are thus strengthening Europe itself , its cohesion and the faith of the European peoples in their own unity .
Mr President , most of the speakers in this debate have understandably addressed the fires in Greece , the magnitude of which , and given their freshness in our memories , is of a scale that even now we find it difficult to comprehend .
But let us not forget that this debate - and certainly the resolution we are adopting tomorrow - also addresses other natural disasters that have occurred over the summer period .
We all know that their causes are , in the long run , partly linked .
I draw attention in particular to the floods that affected many parts of England , including my own constituency of Yorkshire and the Humber .
I would urge the Commission and all those involved in processing the requests that have now been made for assistance from the European Union budget - and for the solidarity that our Union can display - to make sure that in all these cases those funds are mobilised as rapidly as possible without undue bureaucratic impediment .
As long as the decision is taken quickly and people know that the money is on its way , it is possible to plan even before the money actually arrives .
It is also very important , symbolically and politically , to make this gesture of solidarity with all the regions that have suffered this summer .
As new events crowd upon our agenda and these events begin to fade in the minds of those who have not directly suffered , it is important to keep these issues very high on the agenda and to process what needs to be processed as rapidly as possible .
( EL ) Mr President , scientists have predicted that within a matter of decades the Mediterranean will turn into desert .
The environmental disaster that the forest fires have inflicted on Greece , and the fires in other Mediterranean countries , are enough to convince me that this prediction will be realised if global warming and extreme weather phenomena continue .
This threat to the European Union should be seen as no less serious than terrorism , illegal immigration , organised crime , etc .
We in the European Union must therefore act jointly to confront it .
I welcome Mr Špidla 's announcement that the Commission 's communication is being drafted .
I hope that the Commission will engage the most competent and specialised personnel on matters of forest protection and forest fire control in order to improve forest fire-fighting techniques .
However , I believe that the European Union should also encourage research into the development of aerial fire-fighting resources capable of operating nocturnally .
How absurd that military aircraft should be able to operate at night , whereas aerial fire-fighting resources used against such a serious direct threat to the whole of Europe should not .
A further issue is the Natura 2000 programme , of which our forests are part .
We should rationally scrutinise this programme , which prohibits the creation of fire belts and access paths for fire-fighting vehicles .
The fact of the matter is that we are losing forests in a bid to save trees .
Let us re-examine this matter .
Lastly , I believe that these studies , which are to be carried out across Europe , should lay even greater emphasis on reforestation and environmental restoration in the wake of such ecological disasters .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the forest fires have affected several European Union countries , sadly , and have even caused loss of life .
Italy , too , has once again been hit hard this year .
Unfortunately this is nothing new ; it is a growing phenomenon and , above all , one that cannot be treated as an emergency year after year .
Quite frankly , if our proposals and demands are to be meaningful and effective , we must begin by pointing out that in a large number of cases these are not tragic accidents but amount to downright criminal acts : crimes committed against the environment , people , society as a whole and its future , perpetrated for speculative reasons .
These crimes must be dealt with rapidly , effectively and severely , in a dissuasive and well-planned fashion .
What role can the European Union play alongside the Member States in responding to these disasters and criminal acts ?
What tools can it make available ?
It is a good idea to set up an EU task force providing rapid help with rescue operations and sending resources and assistance , but we must take a broader approach going to the very root of the problem .
We must combat criminality and its perverse system of speculative gain by instituting legislative coordination among the Member States with regard to land management and the intended use of areas subject to fire and destruction .
Time constraints must be laid down to act as a bar to illegal construction in farming and animal-rearing areas .
Resources must be invested in helping local communities by establishing a common reporting network .
That is how to put prevention before law enforcement .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it has been made clear several times in today 's debate that the recent natural disasters in Member States of the EU , and not only in Greece , have shown that besides the measures which must be taken at national level , there is an urgent need for better crisis response mechanisms for the European Union as a whole .
As the rapporteur for the Solidarity Fund , I am mystified as to why the Council has so far dissented from debating the revised version of the 2002 solidarity instrument , which was adopted one and a half years ago by the Commission and European Parliament .
This new revised version is a more flexible and straightforward instrument for the provision of assistance : if it is not mobilised now under the Portuguese Presidency , in the wake of these recent disasters , when will it be mobilised ?
Europe 's citizens are quite rightly asking themselves : why is the EU not capable of acting more swiftly ?
How much is the much-vaunted solidarity among Member States worth ?
The answer to that question is determined by crisis situations like this one , in my view .
The version of the Solidarity Fund adopted by the European Parliament in 2006 is a strong and flexible instrument which serves the interests of the EU , and its deployment will enable those living in eligible areas to benefit from effective assistance and support based on solidarity .
This fund is not only a mechanism for restoring normality and functionality , infrastructure and economic and social life ; it also - and this is important for the EU - sends out a clear political signal from the EU to citizens who find themselves in an acute crisis .
It is not about endowing the fund with more money .
That is not a contentious issue ; a nominal budget line of one billion euros should be maintained .
In light of recent events , however , I appeal to the Council - and the Portuguese Presidency in particular - to make this revised solidarity instrument 's entry into force a priority .
- ( ES ) Mr President , I wish to express solidarity with the Greek people after this summer 's disaster and most especially my condolences to the families of those who have been lost .
As has been said on many occasions , natural disasters are not exclusive to Greece .
In Spain this summer , in fact , we had several large fires in Valencia and the Canary Islands in particular .
Fortunately the state facilities worked well , the fires were put out in good time , and the State institutions are now dealing with compensation for those affected .
I agree with my colleague Mr Galeote , and I am delighted with his rather tardy conversion , in that this kind of debate cannot be used to level attacks at a specific government .
The remarks made here by the Socialist Members have been proper at all times and aimed at expressing solidarity with Greece , not using the situation for political gain .
I trust the People 's Party will feel able to maintain this attitude in future debates .
I believe in any case that Dagmar Roth-Behrendt has expressed things very well indeed : basic jurisdiction still falls to the Member States , but action may be taken at EU level through the Solidarity Fund .
The Commissioner , Mrs Roth-Behrendt and other speakers have singled out delays in the development of the European Solidarity Fund .
I hope that Portugal , a country particularly prone to this kind of disaster , will use its presidency to further the development of the Solidarity Fund so that we may all work together in the future should there be any repetition of such disasters .
( EL ) Mr President , we experienced unprecedented conditions in Greece this summer , and it is sad that so great a disaster should strike at human level .
However , today I should like to pay special attention to the threat posed to archaeological sites by natural disasters .
Natural disasters , especially this summer 's forest fires in Greece , have endangered monuments of major importance to European cultural heritage .
It was agonising to watch the salvage of the Ancient Olympia museum and the archaeological site of the first Olympic Games .
Owing to the weather , the fire could not be contained before it had reached the archaeological site .
Despite all efforts , the vegetation of the ancient forest on the Kronius Hill was entirely destroyed .
Ancient Olympia is part of the world 's cultural heritage .
This was the birthplace of the Olympic Games , the most important games in Ancient Greece .
As an institution held in honour of Zeus , the Games shone throughout the land in antiquity , and today their light reaches all parts of the globe .
Apart from the sporting competitions themselves , cultural activities used to , and still do , play a key part in the event .
Ancient Olympia is the cradle of civilisation .
I am therefore giving it a special mention in the resolution .
Finally , in this context , allow me to request that resources be earmarked especially for such cases , to ensure that monuments and sites of European cultural heritage are protected against disaster in future and are restored if damaged by fire .
( EL ) Mr President , we are talking about an unprecedented disaster , the loss of human lives , and an economic and environmental disaster .
This has been brought about by climate change , drought and high temperatures , as well as a lack of prevention and planning , and especially a lack of coordinated action .
We must take immediate , concerted action to support the victims .
Reforestation and restoration of the protected areas must begin immediately .
We must also prevent the illegal conversion of land into building sites .
We can achieve this through a ' European reflex ' , provided we mobilise Community funds without bureaucratic delay ; adopt and enforce strict environmental legislation to protect forests and ecosystems ; establish an independent European rapid-response team ; and implement a European strategy to combat the impact of climate change .
However , we should also highlight the needs of the more vulnerable sections of the population , such as children , the elderly and the disabled .
I should like to thank Commissioner Špidla for reminding us that we should incorporate anti-exclusion measures into Greece 's plan of action .
( RO ) Mr President , Europe experienced a tragedy with the natural disaster in Greece this summer : loss of human lives and thousands of hectares of forests destroyed .
This will , of course , have an extremely negative impact environmentally and economically .
The European Union was involved in providing human and material / operational assistance and I hope that the experience acquired will contribute to the future of European civil protection .
Reality shows that creating a permanent European rapid reaction force is necessary .
This should include reaction teams depending on the various forms of natural disasters and organised around regional centres in order to reduce the reaction time .
We also have to be sure that a mechanism is in place for making amounts available from the Solidarity Fund .
Beside the devastating fires this summer , Eastern Europe , especially Romania , faced an extreme drought and over recent years , terrible floods have also affected several countries .
In 2005 , Romania faced the most serious floods of the last 20 years and they affected all parts of the country .
Romania received financial assistance from the European Union for the projects in the affected regions but the monies were released late compared to the moment when they would have been the most effective .
This summer , the abnormally high temperatures in Romania caused deaths , hundreds of people fainted , the Danube ran half dry while , last year , it flooded tens of thousands hectares of land , 10 districts were declared disaster areas and , for the first time , a red alert was declared .
It is obvious that the Member States should take a joint approach to the issue of climate change .
The Commission on Climate Change should draw some clear conclusions as soon as possible on the causes and the necessary measures to be taken in order to eliminate these causes .
( PT ) Mr President , I want to start by adding my own words of support for the victims of these disasters , from the Canary Islands in the west to Greece and Bulgaria in the east .
As others have done , I also want to commend the work of the civil protection services and in particular the fire-fighters in tackling these disasters .
I especially want to welcome the statement made by Commissioner Dimas on 31 July in which he stressed the importance of the report by former Commissioner Barnier and its implementation so that Europe can be properly equipped with a civil protection mechanism capable of providing the response that has been lacking .
While it is true that coordination exists , we cannot forget the limits of this coordination : for example , the fact that the various appeals made by Bulgaria in July went unanswered .
The road forward seems very clear to me : the Commission must use the contents of this report to develop its own proposal and we in Parliament , and naturally also the Council , should duly consider and follow up these proposals , which are so important for the future of European civil protection .
Mr President , it is very clear in the motion for a resolution that we have had a Europe of excessive weather conditions , whether we consider the heat or the floods .
We have heard a great deal .
Obviously I , alongside my other colleagues , express my deepest sympathy for those who have suffered from the fires in Greece .
Equally there are those , as Mr Corbett mentioned , who have suffered from floods , which happens to be the case in my constituency .
I am surprised the Commissioner did not raise this .
After all , we are talking about natural catastrophes and that also includes floods .
We have had amongst the wettest months of June and July on record , in my country .
As a result , the Association of British Insurers reckons damages could be up to EUR 5 billion .
Ten lives have been lost , countless homes have been destroyed , countless businesses dislocated and infrastructure has been destroyed .
Therefore , it would be extremely important that floods are also included in any action which the Commission wishes to propose .
Commissioner , local people are asking questions such as : can the EU give grants which might be matched by national funding to prevent further flooding by building flood defences ?
Secondly , should the EU review its directive which prevents the spoil from dredging rivers and streams being left on the banks of these rivers ?
When we look at the estimates in the future , no one can doubt that these conditions will probably get worse .
Climatologists expect the national rainfall average to increase by something like 20 % , which can fall in extreme torrential downpours when you get a month 's rain within a day .
In this particular circumstance , it would be very satisfying for those who might be listening to the debates in my constituency , Mr Corbett 's constituency or across the UK , that you can assure them that the floods will be included , as we stated in paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution from our group , and that the aid will be given as soon and as expeditiously as possible .
As general rapporteur of the 2007 budget , I can assure you that I will be keeping a very close eye to make sure that the funds are properly and efficiently spent .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first and foremost please allow me , on behalf of the ITS Group , to express my condolences and support for the families of the victims and for the Greek people as a whole .
Sixty-three people dead , others disappeared , villages destroyed , 200 000 hectares burned , as my colleagues have already mentioned , tens of thousands of heads of cattle burned , with all the consequences this entails for the national economy , and local economies in particular , as yet unassessed : this is the sad result of the forest fires that have ravaged Greece since the end of August .
The European Union , as usual , will be taking out its chequebook to assist with the rebuilding work and , as usual , it is using a tragic situation to propose an extension of its powers by creating a permanent European civil protection body .
This , however , would have contributed nothing to the solidarity of the European countries that sent helicopters , water bomber units and fire-fighters to assist their Greek colleagues , as they did two years ago in Portugal , and as they will do in years to come whenever a Member State requires their assistance .
As on every occasion the European Union is concealing its own responsibilities .
Forest fire prevention policy has no autonomous financing and finds itself henceforth floundering around in the Life programme , which focuses on training , communication and statistical monitoring of fires in the small element on this issue .
The Greeks are angry and they have every right to be , because the scale of this disaster is obviously the result of a number of human malfunctions : neglected undergrowth , poorly trained fire-fighters , insufficient facilities , no coordination of operations , inadequate town planning policies , calls for assistance arriving too late and , in particular , no prevention facilities .
This is all the more staggering in the case of a Mediterranean country where fires and drought are common occurrences , and which was going through its third heat wave since the beginning of the year .
There was no realisation that , in due consideration of the climate characteristics , there ought to have been a genuine air force of water bombers .
It is not , however , only Mr Karamanlis 's Government that must be singled out here , even if its wait-and-see attitude during the initial days was particularly scandalous : only 1 000 fire-fighters , only 440 soldiers .
Certain parties must be singled out , and the blame also lies with its socialist predecessors , the PASOK .
New Democracy and its allies are collectively responsible for the insufficient human and material fire-fighting resources , but also for the absence of something fit to be called a fire prevention policy .
The terrible recent catastrophe in Greece merely points , unfortunately , to a failure in the system , and in a few days the Greek people will have the chance to chastise a compromised political class and choose others to make political decisions .
Let us hope they make the right choice !
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , a debate concerning such an important subject is bound to touch on other topics that are directly or indirectly related .
Allow me to make a few general comments on European solidarity , on the Solidarity Fund and on some events that may provide lessons for the future .
In 2002 I had the experience of leading a country that was struck by terrible floods , together with the Federal Republic of Germany and Austria .
It was the scale of that disaster that provided the incentive for the creation of the Solidarity Fund .
The disaster occurred in August and the first payments were received by the Czech Republic the following January .
I can say without hesitation that it was incredibly fast : starting from zero , formulating a political concept , setting up the structure and putting the aid into practice .
That aid was significant and it was very much appreciated in our country .
I have been aware ever since of the importance of solidarity , not just on financial terms , but also in general .
I will never forget those Danish and French fire-fighters and the many people from all other parts of Europe who played their part in helping us to cope with that disaster .
My experience made me realise that no matter how well organised a country may be , there will always be disasters that go beyond its own borders .
No country can permanently maintain the level of resources necessary to cope with such extreme situations .
I therefore believe that it is right to strive to find ways and means that allow us to act in such situations in a coordinated manner at EU level .
This is absolutely crucial .
The concrete form it will take may still be open to discussion .
What is evident , however , is that the capability to react and mobilise all of the possible resources at EU level or through the EU is enormously important and is still insufficient at present .
There has been little mention of the fact that Bulgaria did not receive any assistance .
The capacity was simply exhausted .
There was no hidden deliberation : there were just no aircraft ; there was not enough trained personnel .
As regards the aid to Greece specifically , it is now clear that the assistance is ready .
It will be implemented at the request of the Greek Government .
In any case , all of the Commission bodies will make every effort to ensure that the aid is implemented as quickly and as effectively as possible .
Allow me now to reiterate briefly what I said in my opening statement .
We should consider the Solidarity Fund , which since its establishment has already been mobilised in at least 20 or 30 cases .
It was created in the aftermath of the floods .
It has intervened or helped in cases of devastating hurricanes , such as Hurricanes Gudrun and Kyril .
It will now be used to provide assistance in relation to these devastating forest fires .
Such are the possibilities of the Structural Funds , which can be restructured as a result of new experiences and new needs , and we are prepared to do just that , galvanised , among other things , by Commissioner Hübner 's visit to Greece .
Another important lesson I have learnt is that personal experience of such disasters is worth a multitude of television documentaries .
Ladies and gentlemen , in our present debate we have touched upon the problems of climate change , prevention , flood prevention , the environmental protection strategy , urban planning and development , and many others .
All these matters are undoubtedly interconnected .
That is why it is so important to look for answers at a European level , which is , after all , what we are doing here .
Ladies and gentlemen , let me conclude my speech with a few simple words .
Solidarity is necessary , and when you experience it , you feel , even in very difficult situations , that you are much stronger than you ever expected .
Thank you .
Before concluding the debate , I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken , from all the political groups , for their valuable contributions .
I was born in Peschici , one of the villages in southern Italy that was most severely affected by this summer 's fires .
Three of those who died in the fires came from there .
I understand the pain and consternation expressed by many Members and am grateful to you all for being so resolute and to the point .
I hope that the Council will be equal to the task of addressing the concerns of Parliament and the Commission .
I have received five motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Tuesday .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the images of the serious fires in Greece haunted us throughout the entire summer .
The swift assistance provided by other EU countries to tackle the fires and the EU 's current offer of assistance payments will not be forgotten in Greece .
However , there is something that has been forgotten in Greece for decades , and this brings me to the cause of the recent disaster : namely the need to set up a land register .
Greece has been obliged by the EU to act here for some time , but no action has been taken yet .
As a consequence , large areas of the Greek forest have remained common land , in effect a no-man 's-land .
Anyone who burned a section of forest and put a cabin on it could be certain that there would be no comeback ; indeed , his action would be legalised after the fact .
This situation has made arson the national sport .
The EU is willing to help the Greek people now , but Greece must take a good look at itself and if necessary give itself a rap on the knuckles .
Specifically , this means that if Greece does not complete its land register by 31 August 2008 , not only will the penalties accumulated - which run into millions - finally be due ; other payments must be considered as well .
As the rapporteur for the transparency of agricultural expenditure in the EU , I will be following this very closely .
in writing - Whilst I appreciate the scale of devastation caused by the Greek forests fires and regret the lives lost within this incident , I must stress that this is indeed a resolution on natural disasters .
Therefore I am disappointed that the Commissioner has not made any reference to the floods which occurred in the UK .
They caused widespread damage across the country including in my region , the West Midlands .
In Worcestershire over 5 000 homes and business were affected and more than 2 000 people were temporarily displaced .
The impact on infrastructure has been significant , with many roads waterlogged for weeks afterwards and some that have totally disappeared .
Agriculture was also severely affected and the impact of this is not confined to the loss of produce but also loss of crops , grazing land and next year 's yield .
Therefore I would urge the Commission to ensure that the UK 's application for funding assistance from the Solidarity Fund is also brought forward to help alleviate some of the immediate consequences of the floods .
It is imperative that the systems enabling access to funds are streamlined and that any proposed EU rapid reaction body to assist Member States also covers extreme flooding .
in writing . - ( HU ) The natural disasters in the summer .
Climate change has turned this summer into a catalogue of catastrophes .
Record floods , droughts and forest fires have caused devastation across Europe .
In Hungary a significant proportion of the maize crop was destroyed due to drought , and more than 400 hectares fell victim to flames in forest fires even though our fire-fighters bravely stood their ground in Hungary - and in Greece too .
Now the EU has to draw the right lessons from these events .
I would like to remind you that arson , deliberate fire-raising , is suspected in the case of the conflagrations both in Greece and in Sicily .
It is of great importance that the damage caused in the course of any incident of arson where protected natural assets are damaged or destroyed does not lead to a change in the official status of these areas .
If it is possible to circumvent the authorities with a deliberately discarded cigarette butt , and if permits , for example building permits , rejected for environment protection reasons can thus be acquired , then soon the whole of Europe will be in flames .
The European Union and its Member States must put particular focus on the proper restoration and reconstruction of these devastated areas .
Finally , I would draw attention to one small , unfortunately administrative shortcoming .
While it used to be possible , before putting early assistance into place , to get disaster relief funds from the Union quite quickly , even within two months , it now takes almost one year .
I hope that the Union will make changes to this practice and aid will once again be processed quickly .
Remember : to give quickly is to give double .
in writing . - ( DE ) The frequency , scale , complexity and impact of natural disasters have increased substantially throughout Europe in recent years .
The summer of 2007 was marred by massive forest fires and severe flooding , resulting in substantial material and environmental damage .
These natural disasters have made it clear , once again , that the existing national resources are reaching their limits , both financially and technically .
A well-functioning , efficient and rapid-reaction European civil protection mechanism is therefore an urgent necessity .
For that reason , I call for effective engagement from Europe and appeal to the Commission to adopt appropriate measures .
Everyone remembers the flood disasters in Central Europe in 1999 , 2001 and 2005 and the devastation they caused in Austria and its neighbouring countries .
The EU 's disaster relief fund was established in response .
The time has now come to make this fund as flexible as possible and to mobilise it without delay .
The development of a crisis reaction mechanism will also facilitate a rapid response in larger-scale emergency situations .
in writing . - ( FR ) I support the view expressed in the motion for a resolution and I also wish to express my solidarity with the Greek people affected by this disaster .
The EU ought to provide consequent aid to Greece as soon as possible , and seriously improve its capacities and means in terms of civil protection and emergency action .
Regrettably , the weather has been merciless in other European countries this summer .
Cyclone Dean , with winds blowing at over 200 km / h , was one of the most violent hurricanes to hit the Antilles Arc in more than 20 years : it caused extensive damage to the agricultural sector and to the electricity and telecommunications networks in Martinique and Guadeloupe , two of the EU 's ultraperipheral regions .
I urge the European Commission to take the required measures to support the agricultural sector in Martinique and Guadeloupe , especially the banana and sugar cane sectors , after their fruit plantations were almost completely destroyed , with disturbing social , economic and human consequences .
It is essential that the new Solidarity Fund and the enhanced EuropeAid programme enter into force as soon as possible .
Better Regulation - Better law-making 2005 : , subsidiarity and proportionality - Simplification of the regulatory environment - Use of ' soft law ' ( debate )
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
by Katalin Lévai , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on Better Regulation in the European Union ;
by Bert Doorn , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on Better Law-making 2005 : application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality - 13th annual report ;
by Giuseppe Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on the strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment ;
by Manuel Medina Ortega , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , on institutional and legal implications of the use of ' soft law ' instruments .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to my report - I am very grateful for their help .
In recent years , the Commission has become more and more concerned about the quality of Community legislation , both in terms of clarity and accessibility , on the one hand , and of its effectiveness and positive impact on citizens and business , on the other .
The Commission usually refers to these goals as ' better regulation ' or ' better law making ' .
As a matter of fact , better regulation aims at maximising the benefits of modern , rational and effective legislation , whilst minimising its costs , so that productivity , growth and ultimately employment can be ensured at the highest level throughout the European Union .
There is no doubt that better regulation is fundamental to ensuring a fair and competitive market place , citizens ' welfare and the effective protection of public health and the environment .
It is an important part of the Lisbon Strategy , as it can boost productivity and employment significantly .
Better regulation is shared responsibility .
EU laws are transposed into national law by national governments and parliaments and are often applied at regional and local level .
There is a risk that laws are progressively embellished along this chain from conception to implementation .
The responsibility for regulating well is hence a shared one .
Many Member States now carry out impact assessments , and some have been developed guidelines .
However , only a relatively small number of countries systematically carry out an integrated impact assessment for new legislative proposals .
Legislating at European level has reduced much red tape .
One common rule to apply in all Member States is much simpler and more efficient than a complex web of varying rules at national and regional level .
European legislation has been effective in removing harmful barriers to competition and conflicting national rules , so the simplification programme can generate tangible economic benefits not only through reducing administrative burdens .
The experience of Member States demonstrates that public authorities can do a lot to reduce unwarranted administrative burdens of legislation .
Such action , according to the Commission , would boost the EU economy by about 1.5 % of the GDP and free up an estimated EUR 150 billion for investment .
In my report , I support the objective of ensuring that the regulatory environment is necessary , simple and effective .
On the other hand , however , we have to stress that such a process should be fully transparent and based on the full involvement of the European Parliament with public scrutiny and wide and open consultation of experts and all the relevant stakeholders - not only government or business , but , particularly , non-governmental organisations as well .
Furthermore , I would like to suggest the creation of an impact assessment board .
It is of the utmost importance that this body , which will offer advice and support in developing a culture of high-quality impact assessment inside the Commission , acts independently of the policy-making departments .
However , this does not necessarily mean that impact assessments must be carried out by external experts who do not belong to the institution .
It is also necessary that the impact assessment board helps develop a common methodology for all impact assessments .
Furthermore , I would suggest a special project within the impact assessment procedure - so-called ' social benchmarking ' .
This project should focus particularly on sensible target groups , for example disadvantaged people , women , ethnic minorities , parents raising children , the elderly , and permanently ill and disabled people .
In summary , I should like to emphasise that better regulation aims at more simple , clear , citizen-friendly regulation , with continuous impact assessment , with a special focus on those vulnerable groups that cannot defend themselves .
Clarity , transparency , simplicity , cutting red tape are perhaps the key elements of my report .
Mr President , I would like to take up Mrs Lévai 's excellent argument .
It is a good thing that we take time in Parliament to consider the quality of legislation and regulations at least once a year .
Our regulations and legislation are the visiting card of the European Union .
They form the framework within which our citizens work and live and within which companies have to operate .
This means that we have to place a great deal of emphasis on their quality .
How are things at the moment ?
They are moving in the right direction .
The Commission has unfolded a number of initiatives .
An Impact Assessment Board has been set up and it is doing a great deal of good work .
However , that is not enough .
I have said it before many times : we need greater transparency and I make the case once again for an external expert panel to evaluate whether the impact assessments of the Commission have been drawn up in accordance with the right methodology .
We need a review , not bureaucracy .
Mrs Frassoni always cries : ' You want more bureaucracy ' , but I do not want any bureaucracy at all .
I only want more transparency and I think that every form of transparency is a virtue in government .
An additional advantage is that when impact assessments are carried out of amendments in Parliament itself - and I have to say , they have still not been a great success - we can look at whether we could put them to an independent body of this nature , rather than the Impact Assessment Board of the Commission .
The fact that there is to be an expert panel for the problem of administrative burdens is an important step in the right direction .
That is a very positive development that should have a role to play in the area of red tape .
Of course , who will sit on that panel is very important .
It must not become a procession , of course ; it must not be a kind of pseudo-parliament , but a small committee of experts : so no captains of industry , no civil servants , no politicians , but ordinary professional people who know what an impact assessment is , who know what red tape is and who have plenty of experience in this area in their national contexts .
The Commission has set a clear target : administrative burdens must be reduced by 25 % by 2012 .
That is a very good thing but it should , of course , be a net target .
This means that a reduction of 25 % from now should , in fact , be achieved and that new administrative burdens should be included in the calculation and deducted from the result , otherwise it will just be a waste of time .
I would like to highlight one more point that warrants special attention from the Commission .
We are discussing reducing administrative burdens now , but in the future we will also need to work on reducing compliance costs .
Compliance costs are the costs that companies and citizens are forced to incur in order to comply with legislation and they are extremely high .
When we are discussing the costs of regulations , we must also concern ourselves with the compliance costs , which are ignored at the moment .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in November 2006 the Commission adopted a working document , an initial report , on progress made in the strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment , which is a follow-up to another communication of October 2005 .
This is an important development that , as Mr Doorn has rightly said , continues a process that we ourselves initiated with a view to achieving simplification that equates with transparency and is a transparent , comprehensible method of law-making .
The working document has been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs , which has taken stock of progress achieved in implementing the simplification programme introduced , as I said , in 2005 .
In particular , the programme will include 43 recasts , and I would like to give the House the following figures : 12 codifications , 8 repeals and 46 other measures relating to substantive simplification .
In addition to these , 500 new legislative initiatives have been included in another rolling programme specifically dedicated to codifications , some 200 of them in 2007 alone .
At this point I should like to single out a few points , naturally very briefly , which form the crux of my report , so as to inform the House of the actual situation on the ground as well as the overall thinking of the Committee on Legal Affairs as a whole .
I have three clear messages for the Commission .
I would therefore stress once again that the Commission needs to be consistent , in relation to the simplification aims it has highlighted , too .
Likewise , recasting should become , once and for all , the standard legislative technique .
Overall , as Chairman of the committee to which our colleagues Mrs Lévai , Mr Doorn and Mr Medina belong , I believe I can say that these four regulatory initiatives cover the situation comprehensively and that the Commission is duty-bound to reflect on them .
It would thus always be possible to have the regulatory text in its entirety , even where there are specific amendments , with a clear indication of the new parts and those that remain unchanged .
This is a crucial draft text for Parliament , as it would result in making Community legislation more readable and more transparent , which is what everyone wants .
The Commission working document in fact proposes using the initial summaries of its proposals to better explain the aims of simplification .
This initiative could prove counterproductive , however : whereas a summary may be justified for a discursive text such as a communication , the same does not apply to a regulatory text , the initial summary of which might contain some uncertainty .
Very careful attention needs to be paid to this point .
Finally , the report seeks to highlight the strong signal of goodwill given by the amendment of the European Parliament 's Rules of Procedure relating to the improvement and introduction , respectively , of the codification procedure ( Rule 80 ) and a new ad hoc procedure for recasts ( Rule 80 ( a ) ) .
These are the matters that Parliament must consider , I hope in a consensual manner and overall without amendment , so that the House will be able to signal its approval of this important matter tomorrow .
Mr President , my report is a contradiction because I have used a contradictory expression : ' soft law ' .
Law is not soft , law is coercive .
The thing is that EU jargon tends to use this expression : ' soft law instruments ' .
What does this mean ?
It means primarily documents drawn up by the Commission : some of these are interpretative , others are implementing acts , while others are merely preparatory documents .
The problem posed is that given the confusion and lack of knowledge about the nature of Community law in many jurisdictions , including the Court of Justice itself , legal force is accorded to ' soft law ' documents .
This is a breach of the basic legal principles of the EU Member States and the European Union as a whole .
The only current legitimacy for issuing compulsory rules with a legal basis stems from the wishes of the people at both national and EU level , and the wishes of the people are normally expressed through representational bodies such as , in this case , the European Parliament , elected directly by the people , or the Council , composed of governments that depend on and are elected by the people in their respective countries .
Obviously the Commission has a major role to play in the application of European law as the guarantor of application of the Treaties , but it must do this in conjunction with the legislative bodies , and it certainly cannot replace the legislative powers conferred by the Treaties on Parliament and the Council .
What law certainly cannot be is what has been termed the ' open method of coordination ' .
The open method of coordination may be an extremely effective instrument in achieving the objectives of the Treaty , but it may only establish obligations among participating parties .
This would be tantamount to contracts between parties , between social agents , for instance .
In the same way as an agreement between trades unions and business , for example , may be binding on the parties involved , the open method of coordination may be used to draw up this kind of contract , but it is subject to Community regulations and can never replace them , and the European Union as a community based on law requires the adoption of legal texts .
Thus we cannot merely say ' we intend to use the open method of coordination ' because it is an effective instrument for achieving EU objectives .
It is not an effective instrument because the European Union can only operate as a legal system .
The European Union has no army and no police force , and has operated on the basis of acceptance by the Member States of a number of obligations met by their institutions , compliance with which is supervised by the Commission and the Court of Justice .
The open method of coordination , however , is not a legal method , it is not a legal instrument for producing general laws , and the two concepts cannot be confused .
As Mr Gargani said earlier , the Committee on Legal Affairs is worried about this anti-law tendency within the EU .
The European Parliament wishes to work alongside the Commission on attaining its objectives , on its executive functions and on its functions in the drafting of legal texts .
( Applause )
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - Madam President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur on better regulation in the European Union , Mrs Lévai , and the Committee on Legal Affairs , for accepting a number of the proposals made by my Committee , which is very much appreciated .
This is an area in which it is very easy to agree on our goal .
However , that is not what the debate is about : it is about how to achieve results .
The role of the Commission in this must be underlined .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has proposed that the Commission conduct an annual follow-up on the results of reducing the administrative burden by 25 % by 2012 .
The role of the Commission is also important in enabling choices to be made when discussing legislation or , for example , self-regulation or mutual recognition , and in ensuring that we have some such legislation and - something which the Commission has also done - in withdrawing legislation that is not consistent with the Lisbon process .
We would like the Commission to see the Lamfalussy process as a good experience that has opened up financial markets in harmony with reality .
However , we would also like to underline the Commission 's own responsibilities , in its direct relations with citizens , to secure simplification and better regulation regarding research funding , grants , state aid , subsidies of various kinds and procurements .
The Commission does have a role to play on its own in this area .
We would also hope that the Commission will come back to the idea of giving citizens the right of action when Member States do go in for gold-plating .
It is important to have a counterbalance to the ever-increasing bureaucracy of all our local and national authorities and , one might also say , of the institutions of the European Union .
One way of doing this would be to give citizens the right of action .
Madam President , the regulatory environment in which businesses operate is a determinant of their competitiveness , of sustainable growth and of employment performance in terms of creating more and better jobs .
As I also said in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we naturally support the exercise of weeding out superfluous legislation , but we must make sure that the legislation we are eliminating is indeed superfluous .
From my point of view as a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , the answer will depend on whether the quality of jobs in Europe worsens or improves .
I support better regulation only if the intention is to make legislation more transparent and flexible , and not if it really means deregulation .
What is crucial is that it is done without impairing worker health and safety .
The 25 % reduction target laid down is open to doubt , however , as it was chosen at random .
If the legislation is superfluous , we should not be stopping at 25 % .
On the whole , however , I fully agree with the objective of the exercise , and I recognise that the EU 's unnecessary administrative burdens undermine the effectiveness and credibility of EU legislation .
I would invite the Commission to also increase the use of the social dialogue , an important tool for achieving the objective of better regulation .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . - Madam President , I speak specifically on Mrs Lévai 's report .
I congratulate her and the Committee on Legal Affairs for its excellence and thank them for incorporating so much of both the spirit and letter of our opinion into it .
Although the ultimate responsibility for conformity with Community legislation belongs to Member States , the actual meeting of the requirements is largely tasked to other bodies , such as regional and local authorities and specialised agencies .
This may mean ensuring their own compliance and / or that of others with regulations and directives alike .
Furthermore , where certain directives are concerned , the constitutional regions have a role to play in the transposition process .
The Committee on Regional Development wishes accordingly to stress the importance of widespread consultation at all stages of the legislative process , including the preparation of impact assessments to allow national , regional and local variations to be taken into account .
We stress , too , the importance of disseminating information .
We call in particular for advance guidance on the transposition of directives and for the provision of implementation guidelines where regulations are concerned .
The Vade Mecum on State Aid produced by DG Competition is a model of the latter .
We call also for the use in legislation of clear and comprehensible language and for the provision of correlation tables in the transposition of directives , so that the risk of gold-plating is diminished .
With these and the other measures advocated in the report - indeed , in all four reports - we believe that we should do much to achieve better regulation in the EU .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , let me start with an apology .
I was not aware that the previous speaker was absent and that the speaking time had been changed .
Thank you for permitting me to speak now .
I was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and after in-depth deliberations , the committee adopted this position by consensus .
I would like to point out , first of all , that there was agreement within our committee that soft law - or whatever we want to call these measures which are now being applied increasingly frequently in European law but also in national legislation - has become a very common practice which offers the opportunity to respond flexibly and therefore swiftly to new developments , which is why it should not be criticised per se .
We also agreed to some extent that the Commission - to turn to the European level - uses soft law in individual cases as a means of circumventing the opportunities for the participation of the legislator as provided for by law .
This , in our view , is a major problem relating to soft law .
We discussed , too , the fact that Parliament endorsed the complaint against the Commission in one case because we ascertained that such circumvention had indeed occurred .
We believe that the legislator encounters soft law in such diverse ways today that we must always make a clear distinction between what genuinely only comes on to the market in the form of a green paper , on the one hand - in other words , it is simply planned as preparation for further legislation - and on the other , what is genuinely necessary for flexible legislation in the framework of soft law .
As members of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection , we do not identify any legislative , any direct impact of such green and white papers , but we believe that when new legislation is adopted , the legislator must always adopt a new decision as well .
The debate , after all , not only focuses on soft law but also on other benchmarks for better law-making , and I believe that in many areas , we certainly have not made as much progress as citizens now assume from the media , which is why all the institutions involved - Parliament , the Council and the Commission - have a responsibility to make faster progress in this area .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , I wish to begin by making three statements to set the context of this debate .
Firstly , we must not forget that one person 's red tape is another person 's vital piece of legislation .
Secondly , we should not forget , as Commissioner Verheugen has said in the past , that 50 % of the administrative burden relating to EU legislation is added by Member States .
Finally , the most important thing is that the European Union is itself a simplification process , because by having one set of rules instead of 27 we have cut business costs enormously in comparison to what life was like before many European Union laws were passed .
Having said that , legislation has to be clear , easy to understand and to enforce , and adaptable to changing circumstances .
That has not always been the case in the past , and sometimes one wondered whether the overall effort of producing and enforcing a piece of legislation did not outweigh in some ways the benefits to be derived from it .
That is why I would support what the Commission has been trying to do in its drive for better regulation and simplification , and in particular the establishment of an impact assessment board .
It is important that all the institutions realise their role in this .
It is all very well for Parliament or the Council to pontificate about better regulation , so long as , when it comes to amendments , we ourselves look at the impact of those amendments .
Parliament also has a responsibility to look at existing legislation and analyse it in depth to see whether it has had the effect it wanted .
We tend to agonise for months over this or that amendment , but often put no effort into finding out whether the legislation has had its desired effect .
I would hope therefore that we , as a Parliament , might step up our own efforts to participate in this process .
- ( NL ) Madam President , I would also like to begin by thanking all of the rapporteurs for their extremely interesting reports .
It is very important that Parliament pays a great deal of attention to this issue and I entirely share the view of the Commissioner that many citizens in Europe have the impression that all bad laws come out of Brussels .
National parliamentarians claim far too often that they cannot help it , that it is Brussels that is imposing them upon them .
We must do all in our power to refute this as soon as possible .
This is the first time that I have spoken on an issue from the Committee on Legal Affairs , and I am speaking in this debate firstly because the topic interests me greatly .
I myself am a member of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Last year in the Committee on Budgets we approved a proposal that I had written to create a body , a pilot project , to assess administrative burdens independently of the Commission .
That means , therefore , that Parliament felt that the internal assessment in the Commission was not sufficient .
I completely agree with Mr Doorn that we have to have a body outside the Commission that will assess the effects of legislation .
The text in the budget that has meanwhile been approved by the Council and Parliament should be the guide for the Commission to take further action .
The Committee on Budgetary Control also prepared a report that was adopted in plenary in July .
We support the target of a 25 % reduction in administrative burdens and naturally - and the Commissioner and Mr Doorn have also confirmed this already - laws that we have just repealed must not be allowed to come back in through the back door as new legislation .
It is important that we review all legislation before 2013 to see whether it is redundant or not .
The Commission should publish regular reports or other announcements stating what has been achieved .
The Commission 's actions and the measures taken to reduce administrative burdens should be transparent .
An internal reorganisation of the Commission may prove necessary .
Finally , to conclude what I have to say , I would like to thank Mr Verheugen for the outstanding cooperation I have had with his departments on developing the pilot project that was adopted by this House last year .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Madam President , in taking the floor on behalf of the UEN Group in this debate on better law-making in the European Union , I should like to draw attention to the following issues .
Firstly , the authors advocate better law-making , aimed at increasing the efficiency , effectiveness , cohesion and transparency of Union legislation .
Consequently , the process should comply with the following conditions , and I support this view :
it is essential for the Council , the Commission and the European Parliament to work together on the matter ;
there should be broad and open consultation on the matter with all interested parties , including entrepreneurs , local authorities and non-governmental organisations , and I would like to emphasise the importance of such consultation ;
Community bodies should be given more responsibility for the law-making process and the overall transparency of the process should be improved ;
every assessment of legislation aimed at its simplification should , however , ascribe equal importance to economic and social issues , and take account of issues relating to health and environmental protection ;
in addition , the process of simplifying legislation should not lead to a lowering of the standards enshrined in the Union 's current acquis .
Secondly , the authors also point out that unnecessary and unclear expressions should be avoided when drafting legal provisions .
The language used should be straightforward and easy to understand .
At the same time , the terminology should be precise and legal certainty ensured , so that the Union 's legislation can be understood by its citizens , who now number almost 500 million .
Thirdly , the decision taken at the 2007 Spring Council to achieve a 25 % reduction of the administrative burden resulting from Union legislation by 2012 should be warmly welcomed .
We can but hope that this objective is more realistic and has a greater chance of being achieved than the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
Fourthly , it should also be pointed out that the reports contained proposals for alternative solutions regarding the introduction of new legislation .
The former included self-regulation or mutual recognition of national provisions , and even the option of not undertaking any legislative action .
All these proposals merit detailed consideration in view of the dramatic increase in Union legislation .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank my colleagues for their hard work and raise another matter .
Although this is a highly political issue , as Commissioner Verheugen said , it is also awkward and often technical ; handling it is particularly complicated , especially when it comes to asking what the term ' better regulation ' might mean for citizens in practice .
I wish to say very briefly that , as concerns the reports by Mr Gargani and Mr Medina , my group agrees with virtually everything .
However , on the subject of alternatives to legislation I wanted to point out , as did the Commissioner , the need to make it clear that their application is extremely unsatisfactory , and I am referring above all to self-regulation and co-regulation .
As Mr Medina indicated , the main thing is to focus on the legal and legislative value of acts .
Mr Doorn is well aware that I and my Group have doubts about the idea of concentrating all our attention on subsidiarity and proportionality , that is , on the initial topic of his report , and on administrative costs .
For us , the question of administrative costs is a minor problem compared with that of the overall capacity of our regulations and our institutions to produce legislation that is clear , can be applied in a fair and balanced manner , is unambiguous and , above all , is not open to varying interpretations .
Discussing these aspects is at least as important as discussing cost .
Moreover , as Mr Titley has already said , the existence of high administrative costs is obviously something that depends mainly on the Member States , and in my view not enough attention is being paid to these factors .
For example , I would like to know one thing : how much will it cost , Mr Verheugen , to do everything that is being asked of you ?
Committees , reports , monitoring : all of this costs money , and if we really are to go down the road of setting up this huge structure , we must know how much it will cost .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Mr President , Commissioner , I consider it a very positive step that we are discussing together all the reports connected by the common theme of creating and revising the Community 's secondary law .
I would like to comment briefly on Mr Gargani 's report .
I believe that the report is very good on the whole and I therefore recommend that the House adopt it .
I fully agree with the proposal that the strategy of simplifying the legal environment should have political priority .
In that regard , however , I believe that it is necessary to strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the legislative process .
What I have in mind here is that Parliament should have the same law-making initiative as the Commission , which would undoubtedly have a positive effect on the process of simplifying and improving the quality of the legal environment in Europe .
I would also like to voice my reservations regarding the targets set by the Commission , which stipulate that not only Community but also national legislation should be reduced by 25 % by the year 2012 .
The schedule of simplification for the years 2006-2009 provides for 43 revisions , 12 codifications , 26 other measures and 8 repeals .
But at the same time 500 new legislative initiatives are expected in the area of codifications alone .
This makes me think that the Commission 's plans for reduction in the secondary Community legislation are not realistic .
Madam President , I should like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur for a sound report on ' soft law ' - a dirty word that fortunately does not exist in Danish .
I am the rapporteur on the same subject in the European Economic Area Joint Parliamentary Committee , and we fully endorse Mr Medina Ortega 's conclusions .
In 2005 the Commission 's internal market experts issued a recommendation on copyright protection for composers and authors .
This was coordinated with the Directorate-General for Competition in cases against rights agencies .
The Danish copyright society KODA has been constantly threatened with a fine of 10 % of its turnover since 1973 .
I would call on Commission President José Manuel Barroso to intervene and defend cultural diversity .
The recommendation and competition case together amount to hard law and expropriation - which constitutes an infringement of EU law , as that effect can only legally be produced by means of legislation .
An unelected executive cannot legislate and expropriate by means of recommendations and competition cases .
Instead , it should be putting forward a proposal for a directive on artists ' copyright and rights agencies , as we requested in the Lévai report .
As elected representatives of the people , we represent music consumers , artists , radio , TV and many small and medium-sized enterprises that make a living from varied cultural provision .
We reject administrative legislation for the benefit of a handful of multinationals .
Elected representatives should always be consulted before the Commission issues such recommendations .
on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , of course less bureaucracy and more legal clarity are desirable , and of course it is high time we got rid of old and obsolete regulations and directives .
If we take the ' Sunshine Directive ' , for example , this was principally designed to limit workers ' exposure to UV radiation , but anyone who denies the ordinary citizen a modicum of common sense from the outset should not be at all surprised by the accusations about the EU 's regulatory madness and excessive bureaucracy , currently reflected in the plethora of EU agencies springing up everywhere .
The citizens are undoubtedly smarter than the EU establishment gives them credit for , and they also notice that alongside the regulatory zeal - the proverbial regulatory madness - a kind of deregulatory madness is occurring , namely when it comes to the rights and security of citizens themselves .
So that no one can be accused of discrimination , for example , Muslims and other immigrant groups are constantly being given almost carte blanche to break the law , and at the same time , the demand for non-European skilled workers is putting the labour market under more and more pressure in order to circumvent collective agreements and other social rights .
That really is unacceptable , in my view .
The citizens are also rightly aggrieved about a Constitution that was negotiated behind closed doors and has now been cosmetically enhanced , and about their lack of a voice in the various rounds of EU enlargement .
Action under the slogan of taking the EU closer to the citizens cannot distract from the real problems , in my view .
Brussels must learn to accept it when citizens say ' no ' , and must learn to base its decisions on the will of the people .
The aim must be a federal Europe of subsidiarity , a Europe in which democracy , the rule of law and transparency prevail , a Europe with which the citizens can finally identify once again .
( SK ) Firstly , I would like to focus on the need for codification .
There are countless legislative regulations within the European Union ; these affect a vast range of social relations .
Since there are so many of them , they are too complex and not easy to navigate .
The EU 's legislative acts are not meant only for lawyers : ordinary citizens of the European Union work with them as well .
There is a problem here and it relates to the links between these acts and the national legislative acts .
Even if citizens of the European Union look up a given law , they often have no idea that there are other EU acts fundamentally linked to it .
That is why I propose to address in detail the issue of codification of laws so that research and their subsequent practical application are easier .
Secondly , I would like to focus on the amendments tabled in the European Parliament .
In my opinion , it is not practical to ' enrich ' the original EU text with amendments that are often nonsensical .
Some of them have no fundamental impact on the topic in question , being simply linguistic alterations .
Some broaden the scope of the future law to such an extent that there is duplication of legislation and ensuing confusion .
The solution to one problem should not be provided in several Community acts since this makes the situation less clear .
As a result , by the time it leaves the European Parliament an amended legislative act can often be almost twice the size of the European Commission text ; this does not make things any simpler or any clearer .
Codification should be based on the principles of effectiveness , efficiency , accountability , transparency and continuity .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my Group , I would like to make just three comments on points of principle .
The first concerns impact assessment for legislative proposals .
I recognise that significant progress has been made since 1999 , when Parliament took the initiative on this issue , and since 2003 , when an interinstitutional agreement was adopted , which was negotiated by our Chairman , Mr Gargani .
However , there are still deficits .
Parliament is demanding - as it has done before in numerous resolutions - that impact assessments of legislative proposals be conducted on a more independent basis .
I make no secret of the fact that to my mind , we should be thinking about whether we should adopt the US model of an independent agency which is established outside the Commission and undertakes impact assessments of legislation in line with a standardised procedure not only for the Commission but for all other institutions as well .
However , another key point based on our experience in the Committee on Legal Affairs is that impact assessments are not actually being carried out as standard on every Commission proposal .
I can cite two specific examples from the Directorate-General for Justice and one from the Internal Market Directorate-General that have remained in my memory .
I also think that it is important to give serious consideration to the possibility of carrying out impact assessments in comitology procedures too , as it is often here that the bureaucracy arises as a result of the comitology decisions and the associated burdens .
As to soft law , Mr Medina Ortega 's report has my full backing .
Indeed , in the Committee on Legal Affairs we increasingly have the impression that the European Commission is misusing the instrument of soft law in order to circumvent Parliament 's codecision rights .
It is not acceptable for the Commission to make decisions as a legislative body at the proposal of the Directorate-General for Competition on which it consults Parliament , yet this is not the case for recommendations relating to the internal market .
As my final point , I would like to draw attention to the issue of simplification .
We need an institutional agreement on simplification as a matter of urgency , as we have in other areas , in order to ensure that we have an efficient procedure .
We do not want to open a Pandora 's box and instead of simplifying matters , end up with even greater complexity .
( PL ) Madam President , it is pleasing to note that in recent years the European Commission has become increasingly concerned about the quality of the Union 's legislation .
The Commission is striving to ensure , on the one hand , that legislation is transparent and accessible , and on the other , that it is effective and has a positive impact on the citizens and on entrepreneurship .
Better laws increase the benefits derived from modern and effective legislation whilst simultaneously reducing the cost of its implementation to a minimum .
The Commission 's communication of 14 November 2006 on a strategic review of better regulation in the European Union , together with the stated objective of achieving a 25 % reduction of the administrative burden by 2012 , represent a key first step on the way to resolving the problem at both European and national level .
The communication also emphasises the need for the Council and the European Parliament to provide regular impact assessments concerning the main changes to the proposals , and for greater importance to be attached to the proposals concerning simplification of legislation in the framework of codification and repeal of outdated legal acts .
In this connection , it is particularly important to set up a special Council to deal with impact assessment and strengthen implementation of Community legislation through preventive actions undertaken by Member States from the earliest stages of implementation of Community legislation .
As part of the ongoing work on better legislation it is crucial for the European Parliament both to become involved in the interinstitutional debate , and also to act as co-legislator in the adoption of the legal acts derived from such a process .
It is important to emphasise the new principles of comitology in this House .
They strengthen control by the European Parliament and Council of the Commission 's executive powers , thus contributing to simplification of Community legislation .
Regarding the role of the Commission , the latter should require rather than recommend Member States to submit correlation tables for inspection , particularly in order to facilitate checking of the process of transposition of directives in each of the Member States .
The Commission should also be urged to introduce easily comprehensible and transparent language into the legislative proposals submitted , whilst retaining legal certainty and accuracy of terminology .
( PL ) Madam President , better law-making is very relevant to the harmonisation of action within the European Union .
I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs on excellent reports .
Thanks are due to Mrs Lévai , Mr Doorn , Mr Gargani , and Mr Medina Ortega .
A tendency to deal with as many problems as possible through legal regulation has become evident in many national parliaments and also in this House .
It often results from a belief that issues can be resolved by devising a provision .
In so doing we try to take account of all the arguments , of lobbyists and of the special interests concerned .
As a result , legal provisions lack transparency and are difficult for the citizens , enterprises and the administration to understand .
They end up as huge documents that lack transparency and are difficult to transpose into the legislation of all countries .
Better law-making should involve the use of legislative instruments with a view to achieving the aims laid down in the Treaty .
Co-regulation and self-regulation may be used to supplement legislative measures , but only when they provide for better or equal scope than the methods involved in application of legislation .
Better law-making and refraining from dealing with as many matters as possible through legislation are not new issues , but they need to be dealt with as quickly as possible .
Assessment of the legislative implications , ensuring terminological precision and legal certainty , limiting recourse to abbreviations and unduly lengthy recitals should result in better , more modern , rational and effective legislation .
The action undertaken will significantly reduce the administrative costs incurred by Parliament , interested parties and those affected by the legislation introduced .
The application of so-called soft law based on Community practice represents a further challenge .
Soft law does not guarantee full legal protection ; it is not binding and gives rise to legal reservations .
It must not be used instead of legal acts in areas for which the Community has legislative powers .
The issues covered in the studies are of great practical significance and call for further swift action .
The success of better regulation will depend very largely on the European Commission , working in cooperation with Parliament and the Council .
Madam President , this joint debate encompasses four reports supposedly compiled to outline better regulation in the EU .
That is surely a contradiction in terms !
Despite the many words written and spoken on this topic , the crux of this issue has been entirely overlooked .
Mr Doorn 's report best sums up the blinkered stance taken towards this notion of better regulation .
After all , that report states that the Commission 's action programme to reduce administrative burdens by 25 % by 2012 ' cannot [ ... ] be equated to a deregulation , nor lead to a change in the policy objectives and level of ambition contained in Community legislation ' .
Therefore , not one single report considers the possibility that less regulation - or , even better , no legislation - is what is required .
This concept will not be grasped by this talking shop simply because , if this logic were pursued , then Euroland would be forced to admit what we have known for many years , which is that the EU is bad news for business .
Mr President , as we debate better regulation , we should first recall the scale of the problem .
No one imagines you can run a modern economy without regulation but , equally , excessive regulation can be hugely damaging , and the Commission 's own figures prove it .
In an interview with the Financial Times last year , Commission Vice-President Verheugen said that he had made a new estimate of the annual cost of regulation to the EU economies , and that it amounted to an extraordinary EUR 600 billion !
That is around 5.5 % of the EU 's GDP .
But what about the admitted trade benefits of the single market ?
Here again we can turn to the Commission 's figures .
The Commission has estimated the trade benefits at EUR 160 billion a year .
In other words , the cost of EU regulation exceeds the benefits of the single market by more than three times .
The EU 's regulatory system is making us all poorer and damaging our competitiveness in the face of globalisation .
My fear is that all the talk of better regulation is coded language for ' more of the same ' .
We do not need better regulation , we need less regulation .
I have a practical proposal : let us agree to pass no new legislation in the next parliamentary term .
Instead , let us unleash the full power of the EU institutions on the task of deregulation .
Let us do the impact assessments , let us consult with industry and then let us dismantle the legislation which is holding us back .
Thank you , Mr Helmer .
As far as I am aware , when I got up this morning I was still female !
( EL ) Mr President , I should like to focus on the amendments that I have submitted to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that have been incorporated into the text of the Committee 's opinion on the use of ' soft law ' .
' Soft ' or ' permissive ' law is a widely accepted dialogue-based form of European common regulatory policy involving coordination , cooperation , negotiation and hierarchy .
My main observation is that soft-law instruments , which do not take on a legally binding nature but nevertheless produce certain indirect legal results , have proven adequate for the effective regulation of certain areas of Community activity - within the framework of the Community treaties , of course , and subject to the requirements laid down in those treaties .
I am also of the opinion that soft-law instruments should be used as preparatory instruments for binding legislative acts .
They are superseded when formal legislative acts come into force , and they contribute to the interpretation and enforcement of Community legislation .
However , I should like to emphasise that excessive recourse to soft-law instruments would signal a change of the single European Community model into a traditional international organisation .
Soft law should not be a substitute where it is essential to adopt binding Community legislation - subject , of course , to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
As I have stressed in one of my adopted amendments , the Commission should make a special effort to guarantee transparency , visibility and public accountability in the procedure for approving non-binding Community acts , and guarantee increased use of impact assessment in the decision-making process .
( RO ) Madam President , Commissioner , the Spring European Council proposed to reduce Community and national bureaucracy by 25 % by 2012 .
Member States should develop a plan for quantifying and reducing administrative costs , by avoiding overregulation in transposing Community legislation into national law .
To ensure better regulation , the proposals for simplifying legislation , reducing the number of normative acts and retaining only the very necessary regulations should have priority .
Non-mandatory legislative ( soft law ) instruments should be developed with the cooperation of democratic institutions , used very carefully but without replacing the Community law , when needed .
For legislation that is easy to understand and apply , impact studies and consultation of the relevant parties are essential , especially with regard to the social impact of the legislative proposals .
Information technology should be used in order to reduce administrative costs and to ensure the transparency of the legislative process .
The future European Treaty will enable European Union citizens , by means of the national parliaments , to exercise scrutiny over observance of the principle of subsidiarity within the context of legislative proposals .
( PL ) Madam President , dura lex , sed lex is a Latin maxim that most lawyers are probably very familiar with .
It translates as hard law but law nonetheless .
Today we are focusing on soft law , which identifies a particular approach , but is not a legally binding act .
It is an expression of political declarations , resolutions , Council declarations , Presidency conclusions , but such provisions are not binding .
Soft law may also be applied by the European Court for the interpretation of provisions , however .
It is therefore a type of law , although the Court states that it is not intended to have a legally binding effect even in relation to the persons to whom it is applied .
In practice , however , the national courts are required to take account of recommendations when resolving disputes .
The former assist in interpretation of national law adopted , guaranteeing its implementation and supplementing binding Community provisions .
The rapporteur has provided a very critical analysis of non-binding legal provisions .
In particular , their implementation by the Commission is deemed inappropriate .
The rapporteur emphasises that in a situation in which the Community has legislative authority it would be appropriate for a body such as Council or the Parliament to adopt an act , taking account of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
I agree with the rapporteur that the only way to guarantee the possibility of applying and implementing the law is by adopting provisions in the framework of institutional procedures laid down in the Treaty .
( SV ) Madam President , as the basis for cooperation within the EU the Member States have signed several treaties laying down the basic rules governing what the EU is and what the EU must do .
This is called primary law and the EU institutions are not permitted to take decisions which are not based on primary law .
I wish to draw the Chamber 's attention to the resolution by the rapporteur Manuel Medina Ortega in which he urges the Commission to avoid the expression of soft law .
As we all know , soft law is non-legally binding documents presented by the Commission to clarify directives in different policy areas .
It is fortunate , not regrettable as Mr Ortega puts it , that the Member States have voting powers in areas where full harmonisation of the law is merely an impossible dream of the federalists .
Community law is binding only in areas where the Member States themselves have delegated decision-making rights to the Community .
( PL ) Madam President , I welcomed the fact that , for the first time , initiatives concerning simplification of legislation have been included in the Commission 's work and legislative programme for the current year .
A better regulatory environment and clear and effective legislation are essential conditions for ensuring better implementation of the law .
This will in turn impact on the rate of economic growth and job creation , thus making a valuable contribution to the success of the Lisbon Strategy .
It should also be borne in mind that in many cases , the way in which Community legislation has been established to date has resulted in the emergence of a notion of a remote bureaucratic structure amongst citizens of the Member States .
This structure has been perceived as being uninterested in resolving the problems experienced by ordinary people or in making their lives easier , a situation which the Eurosceptics are busy exploiting .
Clearly , simplification cannot be confined to the European level .
It must also take place at national level , so that the benefits of Community simplification are not squandered due to national regulations .
I strongly support the calls to the European Commission urging it to monitor this process at national level too .
On its own , however , simplifying legislation does not guarantee that it will be of a better quality .
We need to determine whether so-called soft law does represent an effective instrument in the context of the Community .
We are all aware that the current model of soft law imposes the requirement to undertake transposition into the national systems .
Not only is this linked to higher costs , but it also has a significant impact on the clarity and effectiveness of legislation precisely at national level .
In addition , this leads to serious problems in the area of case-law , as it increases waiting time because of the need to address prejudicial questions to the European Court of Justice .
I agree with the statement that so-called soft law all too often amounts to an ambiguous and ineffective instrument that can have a negative impact on Community legislation and the institutional balance .
It should not be used as a substitute for desirable but unadopted legislation .
An effective system of assessment of the impact of legal acts is a sine qua non for ensuring high quality and effective Community or national legislation .
I believe much still remains to be done in this area , and I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to emphasise how important it is for the institution charged with carrying out impact assessments to be entirely independent .
Better law-making must also mean the involvement of the European Parliament both in interinstitutional debate and as a co-legislator .
( PL ) Madam President , I welcome the fact that we are paying increasing attention to the quality of appropriate European Community legislation .
The latter is the subject of scrutiny in terms of its transparency , accessibility and effectiveness .
It should , however , be borne in mind that better law-making includes all aspects of the legislative process , from the initial concept through to its introduction and implementation .
Accordingly , when discussing better regulation we should also consider every level of administration .
The administrative structure must not be allowed to grow unnecessarily , with all the burdens that implies .
This applies not only to the European administration but also to the administration at Member State level .
Accordingly , both the European Union and the Member States should launch an ambitious strategy to reduce administrative burdens , bearing in mind that such burdens arise out of both European and national legislation .
It is incumbent on the Member States , however , to devise and implement programmes to simplify administrative actions and provide more systematic assessment of the social and economic effects of implementing Community legislation .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I did not think I was going to get to make this speech , I thought I would have to send it to you later , but I very much wanted to participate on behalf of my group .
Clearly , these are four very important reports that we have been discussing on better law-making .
Although it is rare , I have to say that I have some sympathy with our colleagues from the right of the House when they say that four reports on better law-making is a bit of a blockbuster , is it not ?
Could we not perhaps have had one clear , simple report ?
I would like to concentrate my remarks on the issue of soft law and Mr Medina Ortega 's report .
Soft law is a worry .
It can be a very useful process to use soft law but it can also lead to fuzziness , unclarity and difficulties .
Mr Medina Ortega tries to be very clear in his report and I applaud that , but there will always be a wish amongst legislators to use , as it were , alternative regulatory methods other than black letter law .
We have to admit that the state cannot do everything , but if we admit that , we also have to be very clear about the dangers of using soft law .
First of all , soft law , as many of my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs have already said , has a propensity to bypass the legislator , to bypass Parliament , to bypass democracy - and that is entirely unacceptable .
We have to be aware of this danger and make sure that it does not happen .
We have seen one very clear example with a very important project to do with European contract law , which absolutely should be discussed and discussed politically , but because of the way in which it was dealt with it came before us as a soft law instrument .
There is also a further difficulty when we use soft or alternative methods to do with justice and access to justice .
If we use alternative methods - we often talk about alternative dispute resolution systems at European level - these , again , are not backed by a state structure .
A constituent of mine recently returned from a holiday in another EU country .
He had lost out on car rental and was forced to use an alternative system , and the car hire company would not participate .
That is when soft systems not backed by black letter law fail our citizens and do not deliver justice .
If we want an EU that delivers justice both in the law we make and the way it is accessible through the courts , we have to be very careful about soft law and make sure that it is still backed in some way by the state .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am most grateful for the broad consensus which has emerged in this debate , but I would like to clarify a few points .
First of all , better regulation is not the same as deregulation .
I must refute that very firmly .
This is not a Deregulation Commission : as I have said , European integration is based on the law , not on the abolition of law .
Better regulation is precisely what the name says : it aims to improve regulation , and to make it more modern , simpler , more transparent and above all more responsive to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises .
We often subject them to the same burdens as major corporations , and that is unfair .
In particular , I would like to confirm what Mrs Frassoni has said : it is not about lowering standards .
If you look at the many initiatives proposed by the Commission so far , you will see that there is not a single case in which the Commission has proposed lowering a standard or weakening the level of European integration that has been achieved .
The aim is only ever to achieve the objectives which you - the European Parliament - regard as politically necessary , but to do so by simpler , more up-to-date and cheaper means .
I would like to make that very clear .
There seems to be a great deal of confusion surrounding the statistics .
I am really quite surprised .
Let me try and clarify .
As regards simplification , this is an ongoing programme which is being constantly enhanced .
The Commission is currently working on 143 simplification initiatives of which around half have already been adopted ; 67 initiatives have already been adopted .
These initiatives naturally cover a large number of basic acts with subsequent regulation .
So if we say that we have 143 simplification initiatives , this means that several thousand acts are affected .
Here , the aim is what I have described : to review the existing legislation and determine whether it is still appropriate for today .
It is quite clear , after all , that after around 50 years of European integration , this has to be done .
On the issue of costs , it is a rather different matter .
Mr Helmer 's frequent repetition of his assertions does not make them correct .
I assume that he is not here , but I would like to make that clear once and for all .
Administrative burdens for companies are defined as costs incurred by European companies as a result of their record-keeping , and statistical and information obligations , and as a result of European , national or regional legislation .
They amount to 3.5 % of Europe 's gross national product in total , although this covers all three levels : European , national and regional .
We already have a breakdown of where these costs arise : around 35 % of them are directly attributable to European legislation , 15 % come from the transposition of European legislation into national law , and the rest - 50 % - arise purely at national level .
It is of course quite incorrect to assert , as Mr Helmer does , that the EU costs the economy EUR 350 billion and the internal market does not bring that many benefits , so the cost of EU regulation exceeds the benefits of the single market .
With respect , that is sleight of hand and is targeted at people 's ignorance ; it ignores the fact , for example , that if we did not have EU law , we would still have national law , even in the United Kingdom , and indeed in particularly large quantities , as we know .
It would certainly be more expensive .
Let me give you one example of how much scope for massive simplification and savings potential is afforded by European legislation .
In Europe we had 1 400 different pieces of technical legislation on wireless systems in 27 countries .
That means that a company in the United Kingdom which produced specific wireless systems had to be familiar with 1 400 items of national legislation .
In line with the Commission 's proposal , this Parliament adopted legislation which simplified these 1 400 provisions and turned them into one single item of legislation .
You could work out the precise savings that this entailed for companies , but the overall message is clear .
The 25 % reduction is absolutely achievable .
With the proposal , we have supplied you with the 10 fast-track actions to show you that , technically speaking , it is fairly straightforward .
All you have to do is look through the existing regulations to see which statistical , information and record-keeping obligations exist and whether we actually still need them to this extent , based on current practice .
In many cases , we find that they are not needed at all to the same extent , or that modern information and communications technologies are making it all very much easier .
We will achieve this 25 % , and this will lead to a productivity gain for the European economy of 1.5 % of GNP .
This naturally has a macroeconomic dimension , for there are not many economic programmes in the European Union which have a positive economic effect of 1.5 % .
I would just like to say in passing that if everything goes well , we will also achieve a very high growth effect if the new transatlantic cooperation - removal of trade barriers in transatlantic trade - is brought to a successful conclusion .
We felt that it was important to provide you with this clarification so that we know what we are talking about .
I underscore everything that has been said here in regard to impact assessment .
This is the be-all and end-all and the Commission 's rule is this : no new proposal without a comprehensive impact assessment , and no new proposal without an impact assessment which has been scrutinised by the Impact Assessment Board .
If this rule is occasionally infringed , the European Parliament has the absolute right , in my view - indeed , if not a duty - to draw critical attention to it .
Without impact assessment , the legislator is not in a position to assess the practical outcomes of its action .
Even if an impact assessment reveals that a new proposal will entail costs for the economy or for citizens , this does not necessarily mean that the measure will be shelved , for there are some things which are more important than costs .
When it is a matter of protecting our environment , combating climate change , reducing our dependency on fossil fuels or promoting the health of our citizens , it is not about costs .
In such cases , we have to do what is necessary .
Nonetheless , the Commission feels obliged to fully inform Parliament about the social , environmental and economic consequences of any new proposal .
That is why impact assessment is so important .
We will look very carefully at the proposals which have been made here .
The most important point which has been made several times in this debate is something which I fully endorse : all this can only be successful if it is a community project .
It will not succeed if we view it as a conflict between the institutions .
It will only work if all three institutions - Parliament , the Council and the Commission - jointly support it and make it their priority .
That is the only way for this endeavour to succeed .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Tuesday .
EURES activity report 2004-2005 : Towards a single European labour market ( debate )
The next item is the oral question ( http : / / www.europarl.europa.eu / sides / getDoc.do ? type = OQ & reference = O-2007-0038 & language = PL " - B6-0136 / 2007 ) to the Commission by Mr Andersson , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the EURES activity report 2005-2005 : Towards a single European labour market .
author . - ( SV ) Mr President , earlier we talked about the importance of mobility for growth and employment in Europe .
Then we were talking about mobility for workers who undertake further training , look for new jobs in their own country , change professions through further training and about geographical mobility within countries , but also cross-border geographical mobility .
If we look round Europe we can see that it is important for growth .
Some of the countries that have the highest mobility also have the highest growth and employment in Europe .
This is very important .
What is the situation in Europe ?
Well , the situation differs quite considerably from one country to the next , but at the same time we can see improvements .
We have seen improvements in recent years .
I come from a border region between two Scandinavian countries where mobility was not very extensive to begin with , but it has increased sharply in recent years .
It is important for growth and employment that people on one side of a national border can move over to the other side of the border .
Perhaps they could not find a job at first but found work on the other side of the border .
This increases growth in the entire region and is good in the long term .
We also have many obstacles .
I have seen this in this work .
There are obstacles in different social security systems , taxes and so forth , and in the lack of information .
As regards information on this subject , we have our cooperation on employment services , the EURES cooperation .
EURES cooperation has developed in recent years .
Partly with the special limits , but perhaps above all through its portal , which individual citizens can access to find information on what jobs are available , but also on the social security situation .
What is the situation as far as taxes are concerned ?
What do I need to do if I am going to cross a border ?
In the most recent budget in the European Parliament we pushed through an increase of EUR 2 million for EURES cooperation .
That is why we are tabling the oral question and the resolution .
We can see a number of needs that exist with a view to increasing mobility further .
In our oral question we focus on nationals from third countries .
It looks to the future .
We know that Europe needs more workers , not least nationals from third countries .
They already exist and we should increase cooperation - in particular with neighbouring countries that we have neighbourhood cooperation with - and create greater opportunities for them to obtain relevant information on the employment situation , social security schemes and taxes .
The second part relates to seasonal workers .
There have been seasonal workers in the Union for a long time and seasonal workers also need better information on the situation , social benefits , and the rules that apply .
This can be obtained from the EURES portal .
Lastly , I would also like to raise the question of whether the Commission has ideas about improving mobility in other respects .
We had a big discussion on transitional rules and mobility between new Member States and old Member States .
There are still a number of countries in the EU that are applying the transitional rules .
I hope that this period will be as short as possible and that we will soon be able fully to apply free mobility so that all the transitional provisions disappear .
It is also important for us to try to look around and see what the situation will be in the event of greater mobility for the countries that have not applied any transitional rules because mobility is not particularly extensive .
It is not extensive and there are probably reasons in general to improve information .
If hopefully the transitional provisions now disappear , we must also improve information for individual workers on job vacancies and on what is needed , what must be contributed in terms of social security , taxes and so forth .
These are the questions we have put to the Commission .
I know that the Commission has the same aims as the European Parliament , but what is the Commission planning to do ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , before answering each of the questions you have asked , I would like to remind you what the EURES system is .
It is a system , a unique system , whose great advantage lies in combining a network comprising over 800 qualified advisers with an efficient portal , facilitating easy data access and interactive data exchange .
Since 2006 the EURES portal has offered easy access to all of the job offers in the European Union as well as to the national public employment services in the countries belonging to the European Economic Area in 25 European languages .
On average the portal offers access to more than 1 200 000 offers .
At the same time the EURES advisers are on hand to help workers and their families who are planning to make use of the opportunities that mobility offers .
I would now like to answer your questions one by one .
I will start with your first question concerning the possible expansion of EURES to third-country nationals .
As you know , EURES was originally introduced to benefit the citizens of the European Economic Area by helping them to find work outside their own countries and thus increase mobility .
At present the Commission is planning to make the EURES system accessible to workers from other countries as well : this will not only meet their expectations but also benefit the Union .
In view of the ageing population and demographic decrease in Europe we must be ready for shortages in the European workforce in the near future , which will affect key sectors of our economy and our lifestyle .
Apart from that , the EURES system could also contribute to a more global solution to the problem of migration from third countries .
As a result , a new direction was added to the general EURES principles for the period 2007-2010 , which provide for the possibility of widening the scope of information offered through the EURES network to cater for the needs of workers from third countries .
Following the Commission 's action plan on legal migration we now want to analyse in detail the possibilities of expanding the EURES system in that direction .
In the initial phase we could consider supplementing the existing sections providing information on ' Living and working conditions ' with information tailored to the needs of citizens from third countries who want to enter the European market , and provide that information in the languages of those countries as well .
Your second question concerns the inclusion of seasonal and short-term temporary job offers in the EURES system .
It is true that the initial analyses that were carried out for the EURES system did not indicate the need and level of demand for short-term work abroad .
The statistics at our disposal covered only the minimum span of one year and the demand for seasonal work or work experience and study placements was not taken into account .
However , following the recommendation of the European Parliament on the increase of the EURES budget for 2007 , research was carried out within the system to determine the need for , and feasibility of , introducing such a service .
The reaction of a number of countries was very positive .
Some partners had already experienced this type of service in the areas of tourism , building and agriculture .
In future , when plans for further development of the EURES system are being developed , the possibility of extending this service will be automatically considered .
As far as your third question is concerned , the Commission also believes that both professional and geographical mobility can play a positive role in improving how the European labour market works , and therefore it is important to support and enhance that mobility .
To that end , the Commission is developing an action plan based on the results of the European Year of Workers ' Mobility 2006 , which aims to increase mobility within the European labour market and do away with the main obstacles to its further development .
This action plan will recommend reinforcing the role of EURES , making it the main instrument for supporting worker mobility throughout the European Union and increasing awareness of it .
It will have three main objectives :
1. enhancing the strategic dimension of EURES by reinforcing its analytical potential as regards mobility flows and changes in the European labour market ;
2. enhancing the quality of its services by offering mobile workers and their families a more comprehensive service ;
3. increasing its operational coverage by reinforcing its relations with other providers of similar services - or with the private sector - and gradually opening up its activities to workers from other parts of the world , as I already explained in my answer to your first question .
Your fourth and final question concerns the EURES cross-border projects and their role in helping the Member States to do away with temporary measures .
Dealing with the specific problems that arise in cross-border relations has always been an important priority for EURES .
We now have as many as 20 cross-border cooperation projects , the latest being the projects between the Czech Republic and Germany and between Slovakia and Hungary .
Apart from that , 14 feasibility studies are being conducted at the moment with a view to identifying new projects and services , be they between the ' new ' Member States or between the ' old ' and the ' new ' Member States .
However , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the time has come to abandon the idea of ' old ' and ' new ' states : in a certain sense Spain is undoubtedly a new state , and so is Greece , and I could go on .
I wonder how much longer we are going to use this kind of classification for equal Member States of the European Union .
In any case , 14 feasibility studies are being carried out with a view to identifying new projects .
These are all practical projects designed to facilitate citizens - employers and cross-border workers - in their everyday lives .
The partners could consist of trade unions , employers organisations , public employment services or any other participants working at a local or regional level .
Through these projects we hope to facilitate the exchange of workers between the partner states and encourage them to take the necessary steps concerning temporary measures .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to conclude by pointing out another important aspect of the EURES work , and that is limiting the possibility of social dumping .
It is obvious that people who are well informed when they arrive in another country are in a much stronger position than those who lack that information .
In this regard , too , EURES is a unique and very efficient tool .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , may I start by saying that I agree substantially with the comments from my colleague , Mr Andersson , on the opposite side of the House , but I would ask that this would not be regarded as a precedent for future occasions .
It is worth recording that there was substantial support for this resolution in committee .
We , as a group , are not tabling any amendments to this resolution and I hope that colleagues from all political parties and all nationalities will support something that is worthy of support , which is the principle that the EU is about people and about providing more opportunities for more people , and EURES has a particular role to play in fulfilling this concept .
However , I have two subsidiary questions which the Commissioner could either answer in his follow-up remarks or by letter .
They are two small points , but hopefully not insignificant .
One concerns the actual use of the portal .
If you key in ' job mobility in Europe ' you go straight to the EURES portal , which is a very good portal and easy to navigate .
However , in order to get there you must have the key works ' job mobility ' .
If you simply key in ' jobs in Europe ' , you get a whole list of other portals , such as Eurojobs , Jobpilot , Topjobs , Careers in Europe , etc .
They may be very worthy , but the key is to connect into EURES .
Therefore , my question is : can anything more be done to make certain that the EURES portal is more widely available to those individuals who do not necessarily go through job search centres , but just want to access the net themselves .
My second point is that I see that one of the aspects of EURES - which I also applaud - is the subportal about life-long learning and there is a portal within that called PLOTEUS .
I was intrigued to hear about PLOTEUS because this , for the benefit of colleagues who may , like me , have been ignorant until today , is the portal on learning opportunities throughout space .
Wow , this is really a big endeavour , not just in Europe but throughout space !
I was looking at this because , whilst a lot of the mobility issues are to do with giving opportunities to our friends and colleagues in Eastern and Central Europe to move west , I also believe more attention should be paid to opportunities from the west to move to Eastern and Central Europe .
One of the blockages - and I speak clearly as an Englishman - is language learning and adaptability to languages , and anything that the PLOTEUS project can do to encourage language learning is , and I hope the Commissioner will agree , a very important part of job mobility .
What I am saying in both these points about PLOTEUS and access to the net is : by all means think about opportunities in space , but bring this portal down to earth so that it connects with real people on more occasions .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , EURES has tremendous potential , but much of that potential has yet to be realised .
It still has a number of limitations .
Our question says that the portal should become a one-stop-shop for workers ' geographic and occupational mobility , but we should be honest in accepting that it has a long way to go before it could become such a thing .
It should , however , be possible to build such a one-stop-shop in this advanced electronic age .
Workers planning a move across the EU in pursuit of work need access to detailed and localised knowledge to give them the confidence to move with their families - detailed information right down to the level , for example , of schools to be found in a particular locality , the performance of those schools , student numbers and vacancies .
The same applies to healthcare , housing and a host of other issues .
The portal includes information under these headings , but it is of a very general nature and gives only a brief national snapshot .
It might seem like a huge task to build detailed and localised information into the portal , but that is not necessarily the case .
A lot of this detailed information already exists on the websites of local authorities , health authorities , local education authorities and government departments .
Web links to these sites can be embedded in the portal to take users requiring more detailed information to those sites .
Increasingly , information being made available at local level is also held in a range of languages .
In my own area , for example , we have everything from information on how to register to vote to finding accommodation available in Polish and a range of other languages .
Finally , that information is often held in a range of languages of third countries , which ties in with the point addressed by the Commissioner .
Inward migration from third countries cannot solve the difficulties demographic change poses for the EU , but it can help .
I have therefore been pleased to hear what he said about the plans to equip EURES to play an important part in that process .
Free movement of workers is one of the four conditions essential for the existence and successful functioning of the EU Single Market .
The single labour market , which is not yet developed , would enable jobseekers to gain new skills and experience and would provide them with an opportunity to choose a job and realise their skills , and employers would be able to choose from a larger number of employees in order to secure the specialists required .
The EURES ( European Employment Services ) network is an instrument aimed at creating a single labour market by facilitating the movement of workers in the EU , the countries of the European Economic Area and Switzerland ( I will not mention third countries here ) .
National employment services , trade unions , employers ' organisations and regional and local authorities cooperate in the network .
Their activity is coordinated by the European Commission .
The role of the EURES network is to inform , advise and assist potentially mobile workers on opportunities to work abroad and on the living , working and studying conditions in the countries of the European Economic Area and to help employers wishing to recruit workers from other countries .
The EURES portal was launched in 2006 and offers one million job vacancies across Europe .
To date , 8 000 employers and 184 000 jobseekers have registered on the portal .
Although the right of free movement while seeking to live and work abroad is one of the basic rights of European citizens established in the Treaty of Rome , many of the old Member States still apply transitional periods for the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 .
Germany is planning to extend the transitional period for opening the labour market until 2011 owing to the high level of unemployment in the country .
Some sources of information state that we are facing a shortage of labour in the EU but others report a high level of unemployment .
There are one million job vacancies on the EURES portal , but at the same time free movement of labour is restricted .
How effective is EURES ?
I will give the example of my country , Lithuania .
According to official statistics , 34 000 workers left Lithuania within four years , but only 405 did so within two and a half years with the assistance of EURES services .
The media often present staggering information about the slavery of migrants in Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom , where workers from the new countries encounter inhuman working and living conditions .
Is this not a shortcoming of the EURES system ?
People do not receive sufficient information about working and living conditions and do not know where to turn when they encounter problems .
Activities in 2006 indicated that new obstacles to the free movement of labour have emerged ; these are practical problems , accommodation , language , employment for a partner or spouse and psychological difficulties while adapting to a new country and planning to return home .
It is gratifying that that the Commission will start implementing an action plan for mobility in 2007 , which will help to solve the problems that have arisen .
An information system on geographic and professional mobility based on the one-stop-shop principle would also contribute to this .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , I promise that unlike Mr Bushill-Matthews , the previous speaker , I shall not speak about cyberspace and the opportunities that navigating around it could open up for the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe .
The draft resolution is full of praise for EURES , the European Employment Service .
We should be aware , however , that for some observers EURES is an example of overgrown European bureaucracy .
As my fellow Member from Lithuania pointed out just now , barely 8 % of Lithuanians who went abroad to work used the instruments offered by EURES .
This amounts to very few indeed .
Perhaps this is not actually a case of overgrown bureaucracy , but the matter would be much more straightforward if the European labour market were eventually fully liberalised .
Europeans would then be able to go job-hunting in the normal manner , and would not necessarily use EURES .
Of course all methods should be supported , including official information about vacant jobs for seasonal or temporary workers .
This should concern citizens of the Member States of the Union in the first instance .
Citizens of third countries should come second , including nationals of countries working with the Union in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy .
Two years and two months ago , as we adopted the guidelines on employment policy in the Member States we emphasised the need to remove all obstacles to the free movement of workers in Europe as envisaged by the Treaties .
It is unfortunate that Germany , Austria and certain other Member States failed to heed that appeal and still retain barriers preventing access to the labour market .
This is contrary to the fundamental freedoms on which the European Union is based , as my fellow Member stated .
Free access will eventually come about , but much time will have been wasted in the interim .
We should discuss general solutions hic et nunc , not half-measures .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , my fellow Members are absolutely correct to say that EURES is creating a European success story .
Without the EURES network , geographical and occupational mobility in Europe would not be possible to the extent that it is today and would not be available to workers who know their rights and are therefore able to exercise them .
The European Union 's fourth freedom would only exist on paper if EURES did not exist .
Therefore , I do not understand , Commissioner , why you are not showing more commitment in order to improve EURES , in other words , creating more centres and improving quality , e.g. through best practice models in the border regions .
Really , they should be shooting out of the ground like mushrooms in order to pursue your objectives in the European Year of Workers ' Mobility and increase geographical mobility in Europe .
More commitment really is needed here .
Regions affected by a shortage of skilled workers would benefit particularly if mobility were made easier in Europe .
However , it is of course the Member States , first and foremost - and the Council is notable for its absence here yet again - which are applying the brakes .
Mutual recognition of social security systems still has a very long way to go before it achieves the level which would enable workers to take up employment in another Member State without forfeiting some of their social security .
It is even more difficult for workers in Member States - such as my own country - which still insist on restricting mobility for a transitional period .
In these countries , mobility takes place in illegal and fragile employment conditions ; the black market determines wages and security .
However , the battle against social dumping can only take place on the basis of legal mobility .
For that reason , I am mystified as to why governments such as Germany 's on the one hand make the shortage of skilled workers a hot topic , but on the other , do not have the courage to allow people from the Eastern Europe countries to exercise their freedom of movement , thereby also defusing finally the sometimes absurd situation at the borders .
I also appeal to the social partners to do more for mobility in the various countries and to impose public controls to bring to light the black sheep and stop them from profiting from social dumping .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , Europe comprises a widely diverse geography , terrain and climate , giving rise to a wide variety of lifestyles and economies .
In particular , there has always been a variety of working practices , and labour laws have developed differently .
Different people work in different ways .
Variety is the spice of life .
You tamper with this at your peril , for it is at the heart of full employment and of labour laws .
The Employment Committee is properly known as the Employment and Social Affairs Committee , and surely the greatest social benefit of all both for the individual and for society is for people to have jobs .
In April 2005 , Germany had 10 % unemployment , while the UK figure was 4.5 % , but then the UK has taken less of the EU 's labour laws .
Many Eastern European countries have high unemployment rates .
They have made progress , they have improved somewhat , but the last thing they want is to exchange the Soviet command economy run by the unelected commissars for the centralised rulings of the unelected EU Commissioners .
Europe does not need the EU to impose a common set of labour laws on all .
A straitjacket like that can only result in rising unemployment , leading to the kind of social unrest we have seen before .
I hope none of us wants to see that again .
( HU ) There has been much talk about growth in geographic and occupational mobility within the Union as a key factor in reducing unemployment and increasing economic competitiveness .
The 27-Member Union has a very large labour reserve , yet because of the unequal regional division of jobs available it cannot provide employment opportunities for a significant proportion of career-starters and employees over the age of 50 . As a result the acceleration of the inward migration of workers arriving in several Member States from third countries , even though there is a suitable and skilled workforce available within the Union , is now an urgent issue .
The EURES network plays an outstanding role in the relationship between supply and demand but it is unfortunate that it has not , even yet , been given the appropriate support from the EU resources available for development purposes .
It is very clear : I have heard that there are 700 EURES advisors , while Mr Špidla mentioned 800 - if we consider this number in relation to 20 million citizens unable to find a job in the 27 Member States , then this is obviously a trifling figure in comparison .
Only 25-26 advisors per country , a mere drop in the ocean , and in no way sufficient for the task in hand .
Another issue I see as problematical is that while information on job-seekers is accessible on the portal , there is much less information on companies providing job opportunities .
There is a total of 11 000 companies represented on EURES , according to the latest information .
There needs to be a much bigger information campaign if the economic players are to be more involved than at present .
I feel that the development of the EURES network and portal and the stimulus for it is a common European interest and so I would urge that the proposals be adopted .
Mr President , there is no doubt that the EURES programme is very important and is working well , but it needs to be improved .
I want to deal with a specific issue relating to mobility , which we all agree is necessary and is good for Europe .
The problem I refer to specifically is that of EU citizens who come to Ireland and have a spouse who is not originally from an EU country .
In the last number of weeks , the Irish Government has issued deportation orders for 120 such spouses .
I know that many more have been informed by the Irish authorities that their application for residency has been suspended pending the outcome of a court case , which is not likely to happen until 2009 .
This is clearly an obstacle to mobility in Europe for those European Union citizens who want to move to Ireland to take up the work that is available there , and who find they are restricted because they are married to non-EU citizens .
It seems to me that this is unfair to those who might want to move , but it is doubly unfair to those who have already moved and are living - in some cases for a long time - in Ireland with their spouses and who are now being deported .
I would urge the Commissioner to make contact as a matter of urgency with the Irish Minister and urge him to withdraw the deportation orders and to allocate interim residency to the families concerned and to end the uncertainty that they currently face with regard to their future .
If we are serious about mobility in Europe , then these kinds of issues should not arise .
I am convinced that the current Irish law that is operating in this regard is in breach of the European Union Directive of 2004 on mobility and on residency and also in breach of European Union anti-discrimination laws , because this is being applied only to the spouses of non-Irish EU citizens .
These are two serious issues , and I would urge the Commissioner to make immediate and urgent representations to the Irish authorities , specifically Minister Brian Lenihan , to have this matter resolved without delay .
( PL ) Mr President , I should like to draw attention to two issues in the course of this debate .
Firstly , it is necessary to fully implement one of the fundamental freedoms underpinning the European single market , namely free movement of the labour force .
In the case of workers from the new Member States , this freedom is being severely restricted , for instance by Germany and Austria .
Clearly , this situation is detrimental to the mobility of workers across the territory of the European Union .
Secondly , strong support is needed , especially for new Member States , in order to bring about an increase in the employment rates in those countries .
For example , in my country , Poland , the rate is 51 % for men and barely 46 % for women .
By way of comparison , in the United States and the Scandinavian countries , for example , these indicators already exceed 70 % .
Mr President , I think there is widespread understanding of the importance of increased mobility and all the experiences are extremely good regarding workers , researchers - you can look everywhere .
The success is very much in the mobility and European cooperation and we know it is important for the quality of employment , for the efficiency of labour markets , we know it is truly a European idea and we also know it is of utmost importance for the opportunities of the individual .
But , having said that , we are still facing a number of obstacles .
It is important to support EURES and to ensure that it can do a good job .
But at the same time we must ensure that the obstacles , for example the transition rules , are removed as soon as possible , because it is a paradox that one side tries to increase mobility and the other side accepts that mobility is hindered .
The second thing that I think is important to say in this respect is that even when we remove these obstacles we still have too little mobility .
That goes for our domestic labour market as well as across borders .
And I think EURES could have an information role in two ways : to those who are trying to move to other labour markets but also to all of us and the Member States in order to make it much easier in reality to move .
That is the challenge that we could discuss further here tonight .
Ladies and gentlemen , I think that the debate has clearly shown that EURES is a good tool , which has a function and is useful : it genuinely contributes to the free movement of the labour force , helping mobility , helping people to find out about the labour market across the European Union and find out about their rights .
On the other hand , and this was also highlighted in the debate , we have not reached any perfect or definitive situation and it is necessary to continue to develop EURES further .
There were some issues raised in the debate that I will not comment on individually at this time because they are of a very specific and organisational nature , and I believe that each and every one of them is worthy of an expert assessment as to its merit .
What emerges clearly from the debate is the fact that the Commission 's general idea of developing this portal and the European Parliament 's general vision of the purpose and development of this portal are more or less identical and afford us the opportunity of truly efficient and beneficial long-term cooperation and mutual inspiration .
I would also like to point out that there were many ideas voiced here that went beyond the scope of this parliamentary question , for example the issue of national legislation , but these are questions that I have certainly noted and I will give them further consideration .

The Single Market Review ( debate )
The next item is the report by Jacques Toubon , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on the Single Market Review : tackling barriers and inefficiencies through better implementation and enforcement .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is an own-initiative report suggested by our political group which , after several months ' work , is supported by a very large majority in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
I must welcome that very wide support , because if it is confirmed by Parliament in plenary we shall be able to participate fully in the work currently being done by the Commission on drawing up a communication for next autumn on internal market strategy for the twenty-first century , and to influence that work to the full .
The internal market has been the main achievement of the European Union in over 50 years .
It is at the heart of European integration and now the Lisbon Strategy .
It is , however , a constantly evolving process and we need above all to approach it from a political standpoint .
That is , in my opinion , the most original feature of the report I am submitting to you .
Europe is going through a very unsettled period and it is important to realise that the internal market cannot be developed if it continues to face widespread scepticism and indeed hostility from the public , who often see the internal market and competition policy as the root causes of many of the social problems our citizens are experiencing .
Any internal market strategy must therefore be aimed at turning that lack of belief and that hostility into confidence in the internal market , partly by drawing attention to its benefits and partly by , at the same time , pursuing the aims of openness and competition and of social cohesion with its various components : the environment , employment , culture , access for the vulnerable .
In our report we have tried to strike that balance and I think that the reason it has received such wide support is that it has largely succeeded .
That is the main recommendation we want to make to the Commission : the internal market cannot be extended and developed if our fellow citizens do not support the policy .
So we have suggested three approaches : restoring confidence , reducing burdens and , finally , placing our internal market policy in an international context .
That is why we have placed an emphasis on all the aspects , such as the environment and consumer protection , that affect the quality of life of our fellow citizens .
We have asked that the national parliaments should be more closely involved in our work in that respect , that they should have a better understanding of the advantages of the single market .
An important amendment that I have drawn up , which will , I think , meet with general approval , is the revised Amendment 12 .
In that amendment , which is based on the European Council decisions of 21 June on the mandate given to the Intergovernmental Conference with a view to including a paragraph on public services in the new amending Treaty , we call upon the Commission to clarify the position of the public services , SGIs and SGEIs , because we believe that those services play a very important part in a successful internal market that enjoys public support .
We already realised that when we were discussing the directive on the internal market in services .
We have also placed a great deal of emphasis on SMEs and on vulnerable persons , especially the disabled .
As regards the development of the right to consumption , we note that there is very little cross-border consumption , around 6 % , which is obviously too little .
We are naturally including energy policy and action against global warming in the internal market policies , as well as the opening up of network industries .
One of the main - and controversial - proposals is to incorporate an Internal Market Test in any new legislation .
That was all I wanted to say in my brief speech .
If we are successful in combining the inherent strength of the internal market and the commitment of producers and consumers to this policy , I think that will be a real boost for prosperity , employment and preservation of the European social model and will , at the same time , give Europe a strong economic position in the world .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , it is my task to present the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and for once , if I may say so , with pleasure .
The draftsman we had selected decided not to submit this report in his own name , because he did not agree with the fact that , as a result of the vote in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , emphasis was laid on the tax conditions for a harmonious internal market .
To put it plainly , the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee considers that , in order for an internal market to work harmoniously , certain initiatives are needed from the Commission to prevent tax distortions .
I can only endorse the view expressed by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee .
There are two other points that I think should be emphasised today .
The first is the operation of competition policy .
Recent events , especially those involving rating agencies , have again shown us , if we needed to be shown , that a single market needs a strict competition policy applicable to all sectors of the market .
The other aspect , which the rapporteur has mentioned , is the international dimension and the ability of the European Union , in the operation of its internal market , to make it a vehicle for international standardisation .
That is even truer nowadays in the financial markets and I hope that , in that case too , the Commission will be able to take the initiative in proposing the international standardisation we need in order to make progress on supervision .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to welcome Mr Toubon 's report this morning , not just on behalf of my group , as coordinator , but also on behalf of my colleague , our Vice-Chairman Mrs Thyssen , who sadly is not able to be with us this morning because she has had to rush back to Belgium , where her parents are not at all well .
I welcome this report on behalf of all the Members of our group .
One of the most important aspects of Mr Toubon 's excellent work is the way that he has taken a very all-embracing and very comprehensive view of the single market , as he identified in his speech .
In a real sense , the single market touches the lives of every citizen in the European Union .
The problem is , that single market and its success and its future development are far too often taken for granted .
As Mr Toubon said , it is absolutely right to issue a strong call to all of us and particularly to the Commission in its work on a new strategy to come up with some radical , new ideas and particularly to raise the whole political profile of the single market and its importance to all of us .
It needs the Member States and the Prime Ministers at their summit in March , when they will look at this document , really to take advantage of that .
The second point - and I am pleased that you reinforced this , Commissioner - is the whole global dimension .
It is absolutely clear that a fully functioning single market is a massive competitive advantage for Europe in the global economy .
It is the responsibility of all of us , all colleagues , to maintain that decisive competitive advantage on behalf of all our citizens .
We are only going to achieve that by clear , far-sighted advocacy of the benefits and of the policies to keep moving the single market forward on behalf of all our citizens , as is done so well in this report .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the PSE Group has just adopted an important contribution on revision of the internal market .
I shall be pleased to let Commissioner McCreevy have a copy later on .
We see the internal market as the greatest economic achievement of the Union , together with the euro , but , unlike the Commissioner , we are not market fanatics .
The market has been the natural place for trade between human beings since they moved on from the gatherer stage .
The market is useful , it even has its virtues , but it is not in itself a model for society .
The market economy is fine , as long as we do not end up with a society where everything is for sale , where human needs like education , culture , social welfare and health are entirely dependent on market forces .
What we are advocating is a social market economy in which the necessary competition is still subject to rules , consumers are protected and efficient public services make up for the shortcomings of the market .
In the United States , the health sector accounts for over 15 % of GDP , twice the European average , but 44 million American workers do not have health insurance .
To avoid two-speed healthcare in Europe , we would like to see European support for health services .
We urge the Commission finally to comply with the request by the European Councils in Nice , Laeken and Barcelona and to put forward proposals for a Community framework allowing national , regional and local authorities to offer efficient public services with full legal certainty .
We ask the Commission to work to achieve a high level of social protection within the internal market .
Any legislation aimed at completing the single market should be coupled with a study of its impact on employment in the sector concerned .
We want safeguard clauses like the Monti clause , protecting the right to strike and collective agreements .
In our view , maintaining a high degree of social protection requires ambitious directives on working hours and temporary work arrangements .
Social protection is not incompatible with economic efficiency .
Indeed it is the States with the best-organised social dialogue , such as the Scandinavian countries , Germany , the Netherlands and a few others , that have the most successful economies in the European Union .
In short , the PSE Group is in favour of competition that stimulates , cooperation that strengthens and solidarity that unites .
I have just quoted Jacques Delors .
I shall leave it to my colleague , Evelyne Gebhardt , to comment on the Toubon report , which I think I can say is generally positive .
( Applause )
Mr President , I should like to start by commending Mr Toubon on the very fine job he has done .
I think that we have achieved a perfectly reasonable outcome with which we can be very satisfied .
I am also obliged to my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the other groups , especially Mr Harbour from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , for their constructive cooperation .
We now have a report that , in my opinion , contains a number of sound liberal proposals .
I should like to emphasise first of all the liberalisation of the postal market , which I consider extremely necessary and important , and also the increased competition on the energy market and general improvements in competition policy .
These are all proposals that will safeguard and improve the four fundamental rights of the Single Market .
The objective is clear : we want to see a barrier-free Single Market .
After all , there is a constant need to improve the Single Market and to better equip Europe for globalisation , to make its economy even better and , not least , to ensure that consumers enjoy wider choice , lower prices and higher quality .
After all , that is the essence of the Single Market .
Fortunately , this report has vision , and attention should be paid to that vision .
The report represents a stimulus to the Commission , a contribution to the Lisbon Strategy , a call for Europe to go up a gear if we want to join the top level and withstand competitive pressure from China and the United States in particular .
Therefore , if the Commission wants the best for Europe and its citizens and enterprises , Commissioner McCreevy will take account of this report in the Commission 's working process and will follow in Parliament 's footsteps .
That way , I am convinced that the Single Market will go from strength to strength , to the benefit of our enterprises , large and small , and also of citizens .
A barrier-free Single Market will generate more jobs and growth , which is a precondition for our ability to fund the European welfare state - and the European public will be the real winners .
It is not only the Commission who must read this report , however .
Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel should also study the report very , very carefully .
If we advocate a barrier-free Single Market , we cannot , and should not , accept a situation in which two major countries continue to hinder , not to say undermine , a free energy market .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , the first 10 years of the internal market added EUR 877 billion to the EU economy and it helped to create over 2.5 million jobs , so I do not think anybody could argue against the idea that the internal market has definitely worked .
For the next 10 years I believe that ensuring global competition will be vital for Europe .
I cannot , therefore , support the view that a common consolidated corporate tax regime will not hamper EU competitiveness and that is , unfortunately , one of the reasons why , as the rapporteur on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I had my name removed from this report .
I believe that the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base ( CCCTB ) , which is harmonisation of tax by a different name and through the back door , will undermine competition , inward investment , growth and employment in Europe .
We need competition in tax , not harmonisation .
If we are to make sure that Europe continues to grow and in the future is a dynamic economy globally , then I believe we need competition in this area .
Therefore , I call on the Commission to produce as soon as possible the impact assessment of the CCCTB on the internal market .
I believe that Europe needs to strengthen its efforts in the field of international dialogues on financial markets not just with the US , Japan and China but also with other emerging economies , like India .
In fact , in comparison with other countries , Europe is at a standstill in respect of development and investment in R & D. I believe that the Member States need to encourage greater cooperation between technology-intensive goods and services in order to create markets for knowledge .
Finally , I should like to say once again that what we need in tax is competition , not harmonisation , if Europe is to be a dynamic economy in the future .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation and for the open and transparent manner in which he prepared this report .
It tackles important questions .
Building people 's confidence in the internal market is a crucial task and , as well as addressing economic concerns , it will mean taking greater account of environmental and consumer issues .
We had another example of shortcomings in that regard during the summer when Mattel , the world 's largest toy manufacturer , had to recall toys for the third time in just under a year .
Members of the public rightly expect a rapid reaction here from the European Union and the European Commission , and we want to see a review of the Toy Safety Directive .
The report addresses the main issues including the role of fiscal policy , and here my position is very different from that of the previous speaker .
I think it is right to flag up the risk of distorting competition if we cannot achieve closer tax harmonisation .
This is another subject on which we are entitled to expect proposals from the Commission .
In our view , there are also problems with the statements on energy policy .
Apart from the fact that the question of separating networks and consumer services is so centrally important - and has not been addressed here - we are sorry to see nuclear energy playing such a major role .
The many unresolved safety questions in relation to nuclear energy , highlighted just this year by accidents at reactors in Germany and Sweden , are completely ignored , as is the continuing failure to tackle the problem of nuclear waste disposal and the fact that subsidiarity remains an issue .
Member States have decided to get out of nuclear energy and I therefore think it is wrong that the European Union should intervene here with financial support .
Deregulation of postal services is another area where we find a lack of balance .
We do not believe that the question of financing a universal service in small Member States and in remote areas has been properly tackled .
Yet access to a universal service is crucial in terms of restoring people 's confidence in the internal market .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , Mr Toubon concedes that ' the citizens of all Member States are having their doubts about the internal market and the other common policies ' .
He allows that the EU has not succeeded in overcoming a crisis of confidence .
Then he refers to the very document - now known as the ' Reform Treaty ' - which has precipitated this crisis , by saying patronisingly that involving national parliaments will help them better understand the advantages of a single market .
These poor benighted parliaments , by the way , are only the democratically elected sovereign legislators of 27 European nations , unlike this absurd consultative assembly which does not and cannot represent anyone but the Commission and its associated elites .
With that , this report launches into a plan to undermine national responsibility for universal services by changing the definition of universal services and including health services , to take control of intellectual property rights , which we all know will include patents on software , to adjust business taxation without representation , to set up a sort of King Canute 's throne on an isotherm in order to grab power and money through carbon trading .
As for small companies , we all know that the EU , its economic partners and the World Trade Organisation will continue to crush them .
Mr Toubon , a crisis of confidence ?
Oh yes , oh yes !
on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( RO ) Mr President , we cannot but welcome an analysis of the evolution of the single market - this major target of the European project - 50 years after its beginnings .
However , it is not certain that significant progress has been made ; the project is seriously delayed compared to the proposed schedule .
The situation is regrettable having regard to the fact that this important instrument of solidarity including the four fundamental freedoms ( free movement of persons , goods , capitals and services ) does not consistently contribute to the achievement of the European project .
Without approaching the issue of building the single market very analytically , I would like to say that the achievement of this target will face some difficulties because of at least three reasons .
The existing gap between the different levels of functionality and efficiency of national markets : theoretically , all economies based on free market relations are functional ; practically speaking , market functionality is conditionned by a series of political , economic , social , cultural and , especially , historical factors that give the character of a more or less functional market ; this gap has unfavourable effects on the construction of the single market .
The protectionist measures set up by certain states , especially those with a developed economy , do not allow less developed markets to advance and this abuse of economic power significantly reduces their rights to the benefits of the competition effects , which is an essential democratic element of the single market .
Finally , the absence of common legal provisions , especially in the taxation field , has negative effects on the single market project , bearing in mind that heterogeneity in taxation could generate tensions between Member States .
I support the report but I think that to ensure a greater degree of consistency , an analysis should have been carried out of the national markets in the States with less developed economies , especially in new Member States , such as Romania and , following the results , approximation measures to the developed economies should be put in place , as this is a sine qua non condition for the construction of the European single market .
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , without any doubt the common market is the cornerstone of the competitiveness of the European Union and of consumer satisfaction .
The report we are debating today states clearly , and in my opinion quite rightly , that this market , of which we can be proud , has been built on the principles of economic competition .
That is why I would like to point out that the single market is now in danger .
The Reform Treaty adopted under the Portuguese Presidency represents this danger .
According to the mandate of the German Presidency , undistorted competition should be completely eliminated from the Union 's fundamental goals , which are always crucial in solving possible disputes .
All that is left is the creation of an internal market by the Union .
Economic competition thus disappears into some supplementary protocol that completely lacks the force of the Reform Treaty .
Once the Treaty is adopted , defending the principles of undistorted competition within the Union will be even more difficult than it is today .
This will not enhance either the Union 's competitiveness or consumer satisfaction .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , the first thing I must do is to thank the rapporteur , Jacques Toubon , who was also responsible for working out our own position in the EPP-ED Group , in close cooperation with representatives of Member States in northern , southern , eastern and western Europe .
We had a good exchange of views and we are agreed that the positive aspects of the internal market extend well beyond what is in the realm of general public knowledge , and also beyond what has been recognised in certain debates here in Parliament .
We are also agreed that the Commission and its public relations services will have a major role to play in making working people more aware of the market 's inherent advantages .
In my view , in the light of the merger between Suez and Gaz de France , the Internal Market Test - which is proposed in this report and which we in the EPP-ED Group support - could very usefully be transposed into national legislation .
It would also be entirely reasonable to ask whether mergers such as this , or other developments at Member State level , might not usefully be subject to a similar test , in order to check their impact on the internal market and to explore whether or not , within that market , they bring advantages for ordinary people .
We also inserted into the report a passage on services of general interest , which undoubtedly now makes sense in the light of the new legal basis created by the Reform Treaty , as already mentioned .
We are agreed , too , that the internal market is Europe 's key asset in the process of globalisation .
Only a properly functioning internal market can afford protection against certain developments in international markets .
For we cannot rely solely on monitoring systems , Ms Rühle , relevant though they may have been in relation to some toy manufacturers ' recalls : we also need to appeal to the pride and the characteristic quality of our own European manufacturers because we shall never be capable of monitoring everything .
We are keen to see what the Commission will propose in response to this report , in the Single Market Review this autumn , and we hope we shall be in a position to take further decisions about the right course for the internal market on the basis of the report which the Commission adopts at that stage .
( DE ) Mr President , on behalf of the Social Democratic Group , I too would like to thank Mr Toubon for a report which , overall , we can support because it contains a great many positive aspects of particular importance to the members of our Group .
That is as it should be , for what we are talking about here is the future of the internal market ; we are talking about answering the questions that people who live in the European Union are asking ; and we are talking about confidence in European Union policies .
To Ms Riis-Jørgensen , I would say this : it is not good enough to read only those passages of the report that give one particular personal satisfaction ; the text needs to be considered in its entirety .
Nowhere does it say that free competition , the internal market and deregulation are the only priorities .
Quite the opposite , in fact , for a great many social democratic aspects have been included .
To take one example , in paragraph 8 we have spelled out the importance of impact assessment , which is particularly relevant in terms of social rights and labour law .
That is the key to achieving the much repeated aim of ensuring that people come before the economy , and not the other way round - and that has to be the priority in any policy in which we invest our efforts .
Another aspect of this report that is very positive for us as Social Democrats is the move to extend the scope of harmonisation , as opposed to simple mutual recognition .
Mutual recognition in itself is not bad , but harmonisation is better .
In effect , we have come up with a response which not only offers an effective form of protection , at a high level , for members of the public , but also makes it clear that we cannot have a scenario of competition between Member States ' social systems ; what we want is cooperation between the different social systems , based on the highest possible values .
This is an extremely important point and we have done very well to get it across .
Another particularly important achievement for us as Social Democrats was the last-minute agreement on services of general interest .
I welcome the fact that the European People 's Party has moved forward on the basis of the text currently in preparation for the Treaty on European Union .
It is right that defending services of general interest should be one of our priorities and that we should address the legal uncertainties currently facing such services in the European Union , with a view to protecting the public and meeting demand in this area .
There is one point , however , on which we as Social Democrats must withhold our approval , and that is the ' Internal Market Test ' .
Nowhere in the text , Mr Schwab , is there a stipulation on this Internal Market Test , and I would suggest that you need to read the text more closely .
For us as Social Democrats , an Internal Market Test is not a yardstick that we want to apply - or at least not until similar emphasis is placed on other tests such as gender mainstreaming or social impact , which follow from the Treaties .
Until tests like these , which are required by the European Union Treaties , are routinely conducted , we cannot give our approval to a test that is not even provided for in the Treaties .
This is another point on which our position has to be very clear .
( DE ) Mr President , the internal market is certainly working if we measure it in terms of overall economic growth .
It is certainly working , too , if we just accept the fact that what we have been experiencing - since we have had an internal market in Europe - is the greatest redistribution of wealth that this continent has seen in peace time .
Yet in terms of people 's acceptance of it , the internal market is certainly not working .
Why not ?
Precisely because we have this huge range of wealth levels , because unearned income is growing far faster than wage packets - and that is why , 15 years after Jacques Toubon , this report will come to be seen as a powerful testament to the failure of the Socialists and Social Democrats .
If you read the draft amendments to this report , you will find no surprises .
There are calls for effective regulatory mechanisms , for a review of internal market strategy , for initiatives to reinforce the social agenda and for a social safeguard clause .
The Social Democrats were in the overwhelming majority in Europe for such a very long time , and 15 years down the line we will find out that they accomplished nothing and that they are responsible for increased radicalisation on the political fringes in Europe .
Mr President , I am delighted to see that most of our Group 's contribution to the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been incorporated in Mr Toubon 's excellent report .
The realisation of a full single market is essential to Europe 's economic success .
More specifically , the various legislative measures adopted recently in the wholesale financial services area have gone a long way towards establishing a single European market in this area , with high regulatory standards and trickle-down benefits for the customer .
In several cases these are becoming global standards , and the next stage is to ensure that the regulation governing this area is properly implemented and evenly enforced across the European Union .
We will , of course , resist further unnecessary regulation .
Yet there are many cultural , traditional , legal and tax barriers that still inhibit the single market in financial services at the retail level .
Therefore we look forward to reviewing the Commission 's White Papers on retail financial services and mortgage credit to see how improvements can be achieved with the least possible intrusiveness .
I would like to mention the Lamfalussy process , because so far it has helped much with adapting the basic legislation in financial services to the real world of market operators and regulators .
The process is still at the learning stage , but a large amount of legislation has been handled and early indications are positive .
Although most of the Economic Committee 's amendments are in Mr Toubon 's excellent report , I am sorry that the ones relating to the Lamfalussy process were not incorporated .
One area that is the responsibility of the Economic Committee and still impedes the functioning of the single market is the tax system .
Whilst fully recognising the unanimity rule in this sensitive area and the sovereign right of Member States to set their own tax rates , the current VAT and excise duty systems clearly prevent full realisation of the single market and of its benefits for consumers and businesses .
We , therefore , urge the Commission to come forward with practical proposals for facilitating EU citizens ' full rights to the free movement of goods , in particular concerning the tax regimes for Internet and cross-border shopping .
Mr President , as chairwoman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I would like to congratulate Mr Toubon , particularly on the way he has worked to achieve a consensus among all the groups for a set of recommendations on the review of the internal market , which I trust the Commission will take on board as well as today 's debate .
I want to stress some of the proposals which I believe are key in engaging citizens in the progress and development of the internal market and in boosting confidence in particular .
More involvement of national parliaments to better reflect the diverse views of Member States and their citizens is a very important proposal .
Equally important is the inclusion of social and environmental dimensions of the internal market , and of course the internal market needs to continue to deliver more choice , better quality and competitive prices for our consumers and small businesses .
Reducing administrative burdens and boosting innovation , while protecting our intellectual property , will enable us to compete in the global arena .
Consumer confidence in the internal market can only work when citizens are able to see the benefits and enjoy the rights and opportunities they have as members of the EU .
Therefore , I hope that we will go beyond simply protecting our consumers to making sure we have remedies for them when things go wrong .
In that regard , I would like to raise the very important work that is being done by the SOLVIT network and the European consumer centres .
These informal , practical networks provide quick solutions to very complex problems in what is perceived by our citizens as a bureaucratic environment .
One of the reasons why they do not want to shop across the border is because they do not trust that they will have a remedy when something goes wrong .
The Commission should therefore strengthen these networks as an essential element of the review process .
I think , Commissioner , we share the same objectives : to achieve an internal market that is relevant and responsive to all - you said that in your introductory comments - and I think that we want now to work together with you to ensure that our citizens continue to achieve the level of access to the internal market , the benefits and indeed the protection with remedies and redress .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to make three points .
The first is a word of thanks to Mr Toubon and the way in which he has directed the whole process .
I think everyone on the right and the left of the House has actually been quite pleased with the way in which things have gone .
I think that the report is very good and balanced .
My second point is about selling the internal market .
I think that this paper tries to sell the internal market and we really need to do it .
Mr Goebbels , you referred earlier to the so-called ' Nordic model ' .
Well , let me tell you that the Nordic model yes , on the one hand is about social welfare , but on the other hand it is also about economic openness .
These are the countries that are completely abiding by the rules of the single market - free movement of goods , free movement of services - with Polish plumbers ! - free movement of money and free movement of people , with people coming in from other countries to work , so these are also open economies at the same time .
My argument is that we should not put down the single market because it is probably the best thing that we in the European Union have ever done .
Finally , I want to give you an example of how the single market does not work .
This is a real life example .
A Finnish Finnair captain bought a car in Italy , I shall not mention what kind of car , at the beginning of the summer .
Half an hour after he drove out of the shop he was stopped by the police .
They took away his interim licence plates which were legal , bought in Germany , and they confiscated the car and they will not give it back until they have gone through a legal process in December .
It could very well be that he loses his car , and here we are talking about an internal market where there should be full and free movement of goods .
So my point is that this report is great and it shows that we really have to keep on improving and working with the single market with a nice balance of free competition and social welfare .
( RO ) Mr President , dear colleagues , the development of the single market is an essential factor in European integration .
However , it should not be seen as an end in itself in front of which the social consequences do not matter .
With the last enlargement of the European Union , it became more economically non-homogenous than in the past .
This lack of homogeneity may be considered an advantage for certain neo-liberal policies , but not for all citizens .
Competition is for companies , solidarity is for people , as Jacques Delors stated .
Beside its undoubted qualities , the Toubont report has some weaknesses from this point of view .
Theoretically , we all support the Lisbon Strategy , a knowledge-based economy and high-quality jobs , where the comparative advantage cannot be a cheap labour force .
The report also states that a major way for increasing business competitiveness is worker mobility , which should be encouraged .
As socialists , we think that the removal of all barriers in light of the free movement of persons and the labour force is a fundamental right established by the treaties .
Encouraging mobility for exclusively economic reasons already generates serious social consequences in the workers ' countries of origin : beside real revenues , there is the loss of specialists and qualified labour force , depopulation and decrease in the active population , thousands of children living without parents and needing special educational and social services .
The long-term social and human costs are not yet known .
Therefore , we ask for a survey on this particular issue because the economic measures should never undermine the social aspect .
( Aplauses )
( ES ) Mr President , first please allow me to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Toubon , on the content of his report and for having the skill to kindle a broad base of support for its adoption in this plenary .
A reaffirmation at this point that much progress has been made in the construction of a Single Market in the European Union is to state the obvious , yet nevertheless it is also important to reiterate , obvious though it may be , that there is still a long way to go .
I believe that experience shows us that open economies are the economies which grow the most and that increased competition always translates into benefits for consumers in the quality and price of goods and services competing on or appearing in the market .
In a globalised market such as the one in today 's world it is impossible to believe that progress can be made using protectionist measures , and of course the European Union , as an economic stakeholder at world level , will only be able to have a strong economy if it continues to pursue measures to liberalise , construct and deepen the Single Market .
On many occasions people have depicted increased competition and the liberalising measures in the European market as a relinquishment of the European social model or as a relinquishment of the protection afforded by social rights .
I believe the exact opposite is true , namely that for the European social model to continue to move forward , for European citizens to continue to enjoy social protection measures and good social services , it is important for the European economy to grow and that growth will only , I stress , be possible if we deepen the European Single Market .
I said that a great deal of progress has been made but there is still some way to go , and one of my colleagues has just given some specific examples of this .
I believe that it is important to remove barriers so that small and medium-sized undertakings can work throughout the European Union .
It is also important , as stated in the report , to investigate and develop the market in retail financial services , and especially intellectual property rights .
I would like to ask the Commission to call on national governments and on the Council to ensure that Community provisions are duly transposed into national legislation .
( DE ) Mr President , we are in favour of removing restrictions on the internal market in order to promote its positive effects , such as sustained growth , and in that process it is important to pay adequate attention to social safeguards for ordinary people .
Because of their particular importance , the services of general interest - what we term ' basic ' forms of provision - cannot simply be left to the free play of the market .
In the health and social fields especially , they need a specific set of rules .
I am sorry to see the quite unnecessary mention of nuclear power in paragraph 16 .
This is indisputably a high-risk technology which puts the population in danger .
So , on that point I cannot back the report .
It also has to be said that diverging national interpretations in the transposition of EU law are creating uncertainty .
As numerous studies have shown , this is a considerable obstacle to the completion of the internal market .
Finally , I should like to mention the international importance of European standards .
The current controversy about faulty toys from China is a good illustration of how important it is , in dialogue with external trade partners , that we should have internationally recognised standards .
Even if countries like China do feel overburdened by a long list of quality requirements , we nonetheless need measures to improve product and food safety in the interests of protecting European consumers .
( SV ) Mr President , Commissioner , the internal market is one of the most important building blocks for cooperation within the European Union .
The cooperation is based on mutual trust and respect between the Member States .
It is therefore also crucial that everyone contributes by quickly and effectively implementing the EU legislation that has to transposed into national law .
SOLVIT is a good way of monitoring observance and can be developed .
We politicians who work at European level in Parliament or in the Council are responsible for ensuring that the legislation is pro-competitive and does not create unnecessary administration and that it meets the needs and resolves the problems that still exist .
To that end we must create a political consensus and a broad understanding of the importance of the internal market , to which both Mr Toubon and the Commission have made good contributions .
Thank you , Mr Toubon .
The EPP-ED wants one Europe for all , with job opportunities for all , effective healthcare and no poverty .
An EU that can grow even stronger .
The only way to achieve that is by ensuring that the market is competitive and that trade is not impaired by antiquated legislation , unnecessary customs duties , subsidies or market controls .
Without a smoothly functioning market and strong European companies there is no money for welfare .
The internal market and competitiveness automatically create social security and are preconditions for welfare .
( HU ) I would like to begin by saying how much we welcomed the clear and comprehensive debate which Mr Toubon 's colleagues held with us last year prior to the preparation of this report .
I would also like to compliment Mr Toubon himself on the preparation of his report .
I myself would like to comment on paragraph 40 first , which stresses the responsibility of the Member States .
My main thought here is that the Member States do not owe it to the European Commission or the European Parliament to transpose the rules of the internal market but first and foremost to themselves and to each other , and above all to their own citizens and their own businesses .
We therefore cannot ignore the July 2007 Internal Market Scoreboard and the information it contains .
A condition for the new Member States which acceded in 2004 and 2005 was the introduction and transposition of the complete acquis communautaire .
We can see from the Scoreboard that two years after the deadline expired the record-holders for overdue transposition of directives are without exception the old Member States , which account for the four largest transposition deficits .
The ratio of failure to meet internal market obligations between individual old and new Member States is 1 : 2 , but may occasionally be as much as 1 : 8 , as for example between Slovenia and Italy .
A direct result of this is that those who abide by the law are losing out because of unequal treatment and discrimination .
When we talk about the future internal market , we all need to insist that businesses and countries that stick to the rules and transpose the acquis communautaire must not lose out in the ongoing development of the internal market .
I would like to thank the rapporteur .
( CS ) Commissioner , 15 years ago the Member States agreed on deeper economic integration and pledged to create a single European market for the free movement of goods , services , capital and people .
In the 1990s this gave rise to a competitive environment for entrepreneurs , resulting in wider choices and lower prices for consumers .
However , since 2000 we have seen how some Member States , in particular the old ones , protect , both covertly and openly , their small national markets from competition next door and tolerate administrative and other obstacles , thus blocking the swift and total accomplishment of the single market free of barriers .
In the light of the rapid liberalisation of global trade , and seeing how hastily we Europeans are making room for goods from third countries , this is paradoxical behaviour .
Would a healthy European market not be the key to dealing with the challenges of globalisation and unemployment ?
This irrational situation is caused by populism and by giving precedence to false national interests over the common interests of consumers and entrepreneurs .
I therefore welcome the Commission 's Green Paper and the proposal for a review : this review will reveal how valid European legislation is evaded in a number of countries and will bring to light flaws that weaken trust in the single market .
An example of this is the grey area concerning when to apply or not to apply the country of origin principle .
If the market is supposed to function properly , we need to make progress in liberalising network services and finalise the financial services market , and to overcome myths prevailing in health and social services .
The introduction of the euro and recent directives have strengthened trade within the Union and made it more transparent .
That said , we all know that entrepreneurs suffer from the burden of increasing paperwork and that we need equal conditions for fair international competition .
We also need more modern and simpler control mechanisms .
I urge the Commission to make every effort to monitor how the existing Directives are being implemented , and to make progress in the area of mutual recognition before furthering possible harmonisation .
I realise that the globalisation of trade will require the standardisation of other products and an agreement on the European mark of origin .
I agree that the disparities in the area of corporate tax are a source of tension and will need further debate .
The European market is a process , not a dogma .
( FI ) Mr President , we should not hit out at globalisation because of the harm it does , but take practical steps .
The protection of national markets is paralysing our continent , so jeopardising its economic growth , something a social Europe also relies on .
To its credit , the report stresses the importance of completing the process whereby energy and communications in particular are opened up to competition , because developed and open networks are ultimately in the interests of the consumer and a guarantee of growth .
To speed this development up we also need effective regulation mechanisms and monitoring .
One mechanism should be incorporated into the so-called cross-border client liability principle .
With that , anyone commissioning work or services would be responsible for ensuring that the activity was transparent and that the subcontractors were attending to their obligations .
This Union and this Parliament take a too ideological view when considering the various energy options .
In practice , the harmful effects of climate change are prevented by reducing emissions .
In contrast to what , for example , Mr Bulfon said just now , it is unrealistic to suppose that we will achieve real and effective results without nuclear power being part of the solution .
Our priority goal must be to reduce the use of fossil fuels .
( SK ) To begin with I would like to express my appreciation to my colleague Jacques Toubon for his stimulating report , which lays an excellent and balanced foundation for the Commission 's forthcoming documents .
In spite of the fact that the four fundamental freedoms were guaranteed by the Rome Treaties , there are still many obstacles to their practical application .
A review of the present situation of the internal market offers us an opportunity to back up the existing rules and revise those that are outdated .
This new approach may eliminate the chasm between the potential and the reality and will offer solutions for doing away with the barriers between the markets of the 27 Member States .
I agree with the rapporteur 's view that the success of the single market rests on three pillars : the first is strengthening consumer rights and creating a favourable business environment , which is especially important for small and medium-sized enterprises .
For example , it is necessary to improve access for small and medium-sized enterprises to public procurement contracts .
Regarding the second pillar , we should eliminate any remaining barriers such as obstacles to the creation of a single payments area .
The third pillar consists of strengthening the international dimension of the EU 's internal market by creating a larger transatlantic internal market .
In the context of the global economy , the EU will be prosperous only when it equals or even exceeds the innovation capabilities of its trading partners .
That is why the EU needs specific measures to increase its innovation capabilities .
The Member States must create a favourable environment for active cooperation between businesses , public sector and academia .
Channelling public and private investment into highly specialised research centres connected to universities may produce a breeding ground for the business community of tomorrow .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , many members of the public might well find today 's debate rather odd : after all , the internal market has been around for more than 15 years and a lot of people have become quite used to it .
Yet even after all this time , there remain some astounding shortcomings , due in certain cases to protectionist behaviour by a few Member States .
Certain things have also gone wrong over the years .
Members of the public - consumers - have less freedom of choice and the market is by no means a level playing field ; it might be that for big companies , but for SMEs it most certainly is not .
We all share the view - and I hope I speak here not just for Parliament but also for the Commission and the Council - that the internal market is not an end in itself .
I should like to quote one of the great founding fathers of the Single Market , Jacques Delors , who talked about three key principles - competition , to stimulate ; cooperation , to strengthen ; and solidarity , to unite .
The last of the three has been somewhat obscured down the years .
For us as Social Democrats , solidarity and cohesion in the internal market are very important .
My final point is this : an effective market implies effective safeguards and consumer protection .
Only by putting these in place can we build the confidence that everyone is reminding us about .
Recent years have seen an increase in the number of products that contain hazardous substances or pose a risk : Chinese toys are merely the tip of the iceberg .
Thousands of products are the subject of complaints .
So that is where our task lies , and your task too Commissioner : we need to use our package of market-control measures to win back people 's trust ; we need to take action and not simply leave things as they are .
( RO ) Mr President , economic and social cohesion , as well as solidarity are essential for the European Union .
The Structural Funds contribute to the development of all the European regions and are important especially for the new Member States .
We not only need an economic union with the most dynamic knowledge-based economy but also a Social Europe where everybody plays their part and in which public services are of high quality and are accessible to the almost 500 million European citizens .
We need health and education services , we need a sustainable social protection system .
Transport , energy , communications are essential for EU economic development , but one should ensure everybody has access to these services .
e-government and the financial service development are essential for the transparency and quality of public services , as they should also ensure consumer protection in the digital environment .
We hope that the restrictions imposed on Romanian and Bulgarian workers concerning the access to the Community labour market will be removed .
Thus nondiscriminatory access to the European labour market is important for ensuring equal working conditions and for avoiding social dumping .
( PL ) Mr President , as one of the pillars of the European Union the internal market is subject to constant change .
Every day we see how much it actually impacts on the lives of ordinary citizens .
Deepening European integration depends directly on deepening integration between the economies of the individual Member States .
It is therefore very important for all citizens that decisive action should be taken to rid the internal market of successive barriers and obstacles to the flow of people , capital , goods and services .
The report by Mr Toubon is an accurate report which sets out the areas on which EU legislation and policy should concentrate to improve the operation of the internal market .
He draws attention to many issues which should take priority in our work and in particular to gaining the confidence of citizens , both consumers and business people , in the internal market .
I wholeheartedly support the idea contained in Mr Toubon 's report that the national parliaments should be involved in the legislative work of Parliament , which will result in the EU being brought considerably closer to our citizens .
It is a very worthwhile suggestion .
Finally , I would like to add that as a former businesswoman I agree with all the recommendations in the report concerning the removal of administrative burdens on businesses .
It is only on the basis of a consistent , pro-market and liberal policy that the EU economy will be able to compete with the economies of the United States , China and India .
I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report whose greatest virtue is its balanced content .
I would simply say that it constitutes a kind of non-political roadmap setting out the priorities for our work on the internal market .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , honourable Members , I have listened carefully to the discussion on the future of the single market and I would like to thank all participants for their comments .
The review of the single market is an essential part of a reference to the delivery of a Europe of tangible results with the clear focus on the citizens .
The single market is not a means to an end .
Our policies must serve the people and improve their quality of life .
All Europeans , you and I , should be able to identify with these policies .
Big challenges remain in the single market .
Some of our proposals are already on the table .
Others will soon come .
We need your support on these initiatives to bring them to a successful end .
We are rethinking the way we govern the single market , at national and EU level .
Any initiative is thoroughly prepared under the better regulation principles .
This allows us to examine all options before taking action and this may include considering self-regulation in specific areas .
We need to improve the ownership of the single market .
It belongs to our consumers , to our companies , to our workers and our civil society .
It belongs to national , regional and local authorities .
We need to facilitate the cooperation between Member States on a daily basis .
I would like once again to thank the rapporteur and am looking forward to receiving further comments from Parliament in the coming months .
The debate is closed .
The vote on this item will take place today .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - This own-initiative report is an excellent opportunity to feed into the current review of the single market .
It is therefore the occasion for our Parliament to stress the benefits consequent to a genuinely completed single market .
More specifically , while highlighting the challenges faced by the single market , the report brings forward concrete recommendations .
Among these recommendations we particularly support the emphasis given on the importance of tackling climate change through sustainable development actions ; the necessity to substantially increase consumer confidence in cross-border purchases ; the underlined competitiveness , growth and employment potential of innovation and SMEs ; the encouragement of genuine free movement of workers throughout the Union and , more generally , the removal of all obstacles for the completion of an integrated and efficient single market .
Of course , these recommendations need to be transposed into single market directives so that they will be thoroughly implemented by the Member States .
In order to achieve effective completion of the single market rules , the Union must give itself the necessary enforcement tools for encouraging cooperation between national administrations , setting up information contact points for businesses and citizens , improving the efficiency of the complaints procedure , and undertaking actions through the relevant courts when necessary .
in writing . - The single market is still the core achievement of the EU .
However , it is far from complete .
There are deficiencies with respect to all four freedoms .
Also , we are seeing crumbling stakeholder confidence in the achievements of the single market .
These are largely taken for granted .
As regards movement of goods , 25 % are still subject to various national technical barriers .
Hopefully the Commission 's policy package from January 2007 will swiftly be translated in targeted measures for resolving the remaining obstacles .
As regards people , uncertainty persists over some basic principles , notably in the transferability of social rights .
I am happy that this political minefield is being gradually negotiated in the field of , for instance , pensions and access to cross-border healthcare .
As for capital and services , big changes are afoot .
The status quo , for example as regards the lack of a common corporate tax base , distorts investment decisions in the single market and disadvantages SMEs .
Even as the EU rolls up its sleeves for future challenges by way of the Reform Treaty , a political impetus for completing the single market is needed .
This should aim to remove ambiguities in the business environment , clarify the applicable regulatory regime and seek to reduce administrative burdens .
in writing . - I broadly welcome the rapporteur 's report and agree that the development of the single market has delivered a range of benefits for Europe 's citizens , notably by providing consumers with a wider choice and lower prices , creating a dynamic business environment and enabling the free exchange of goods , services and ideas .
This in turn has facilitated European integration across a range of areas and continues to underpin the EU 's ability to achieve its broad objectives .
However , I have reservations about particular elements of this report :
I do not agree that the introduction of a common consolidated tax base is either necessary or desirable , as suggested in this report .
I believe that such a proposal , were it to be tabled by the Commission , would be a first step towards tax harmonisation , which I would find unacceptable .
I believe that Member States are best placed to determine the nature and scope of their respective tax systems .
Finally , I believe that the report 's reference to nuclear power as an essential part of the EU 's energy mix is misplaced and I will not be supporting this element of the report .
Statute of the European Private Company , Company Law ( debate )
The next item is the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , to the Commission on the state of play in the legislative proceedings on the ' Statute of the European Private Company ' and of the ' Fourteenth Company Law Directive ' - B6-0137 / 0000 ) .
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the debate on this question is very important both institutionally and politically , bearing in mind that it is of considerable political and institutional significance .
I should like to say very clearly , and I take responsibility for my words , that the European Commission has seriously failed the European Parliament since it has failed to follow up Parliament 's formal requests and has failed to present proposals for legislation on European Private Companies and relocations of head offices of capital companies .
It was the Commission 's duty , Commissioner , immediately to launch the procedure for adopting the legislative proposal , starting with an impact assessment .
The Commission already had , moreover , a feasibility study from December 2005 , but did nothing and instead took its time until in July it launched a consultation on the need - here again no more than a hypothetical discussion - for a European Private Company , as though Parliament , as the elected representative of the Union as a whole , could not legitimately base its request on a substantive legislative act .
I shall not look in detail at the European legislation , as Klaus Lehne , one of the Committee 's main experts and a leader in this field , will shortly talk about the legal aspects of the question .
I should like to look at the problem in greater depth and remind the Commissioner , so that he can give due consideration to everything that I say , of the relationship that exists between the institutions and on which the necessary cooperation between the Commission and Parliament has to be based .
In my opinion , Commissioner , you personally have done Parliament a discourtesy , you have snubbed Parliament .
You have ignored Parliament 's requests adopted on the basis of Article 192 and in particular the interinstitutional agreement ' Better Regulation ' , and there have been many failures to act - I have been Chairman of that committee and I am very well aware how many questions are pending - even though the Commission had formally undertaken not only to take account of requests but also to provide rapid and appropriate answers to Parliament 's committees .
That has not been the case at all !
The failure to comply with those obligations brings up the Commission 's accountability , which I have no difficulty in defining as legal , to the European Parliament .
At the conference on company law organised by the German Presidency , Mr Lehne rightly said that the European Commission could be brought before the Court for Justice for failure to fulfil its obligations .
Parliament , and I say this very clearly , should be aware that the Commission , on its Internet site , has already confirmed that the consultations held in 1997 and 2002 showed a high-level and specific demand from economic operators .
The Commission therefore knows how important this issue is and is aware that it has a duty and an obligation to reply to Parliament 's requests .
Not only has it failed to approve the proposal for legislation , but at the Berlin conference the Commissioner went as far as to say that further discussion of the usefulness of the proposal was necessary .
That has left us very perplexed because we now need to consider - as the Commissioner says - whether the European Parliament still has a chance effectively to demonstrate the validity of that proposal for legislation .
A directive in this field - I am concluding - would certainly provide a sound legal basis for companies ' freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services .
We are awaiting a detailed proposal from the Commissioner which means not just going along with the various lobbies , from England , from the United Kingdom and Ireland , I think , but addressing an adverse situation .
It is not the interests of individual countries that have to be served , Commissioner , as you are well aware , but the interests of Europeans !
Parliament is not a lobby and we are actually and tangibly expressing that requirement and that necessity !
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , the oral question tabled by Mr Gargani , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , gives me the opportunity to provide you with an update on where the Commission stands regarding the 14th Company Law Directive and the European Private Company ( EPC ) .
As you are aware , and as part of our ' better regulation ' approach , a public consultation on the EPC statute was launched on 20 July by the Directorate-General for the Internal Market and Services .
This consultation aims at gathering stakeholders ' views on the need for such a statute and its possible content .
I know that the European Parliament would like the Commission to accelerate the process .
However , we need to do the necessary preparatory work .
An essential part of this is to consult stakeholders on different possible regulatory options - that is , a more uniform but less flexible statute , or a statute which gives a lot of freedom to users but results in a variety of EPC structures across the European Union .
We need to hear stakeholders ' opinions on which option is the most attractive for companies .
That is what better regulation is about .
The feasibility study at the end of 2005 offered a rather general assessment of the current situation , but does not provide a clear answer as to the best policy option and the possible elements of the EPC statute .
That is why we need a more in-depth analysis .
The study will , of course , provide good background material for our work .
We have also benefited from the European Parliament 's report on the EPC statute and its recommendations on the possible content of such a statute .
Concerning the proposal for a 14th Company Law Directive , the preparatory work on this issue has not been conclusive .
Our better regulation and impact policy requires us to demonstrate that an initiative has clear economic benefit before embarking upon it .
I should be in a position shortly to make a more definitive statement on this issue in regard to the value added of such a proposal .
We need to reflect further before making such a proposal , which , frankly , risks being controversial .
As Members know , I am not afraid of being controversial , but I need to be convinced that the potential benefits for the European Union of such an initiative merit a legislative proposal .
This is not about procrastination but about the belief that , to produce good quality work , the preparatory work must be carried out properly .
Within the next couple of months I will inform Members of how I intend to proceed on these important issues .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I must say I am pleased that Commissioner McCreevy , in his answer to this oral question , did not reject the European Parliament 's suggestions .
Over the past few years , there have been so many hearings and consultations about the European Private Company that I cannot understand why we need to have a third , a fourth , a fifth and perhaps even a sixth or however many more .
The matter is closed .
We had an initial proposal in the Commission 's action plan .
That was approved , in the revised action plan , by the majority of stakeholders .
The hearings in Parliament produced an unequivocal message .
Parliament 's decisions could not have been clearer , and on that basis I cannot accept any further delays .
Experts are generally agreed that there is a gap in the law in the Directive on the cross-border transfer of registered seat .
The European Union offers freedom of movement of capital - that is , the option of moving one 's property or capital to a different location - but if I own a business , I do not currently have that option because I cannot decide freely where to base my business , or where to transfer it to , within the European Union .
That is very clearly a gap in the law .
The Commission , in its annual legislative programme , announced its intention of closing the gap .
Currently we have a situation where the European Court of Justice is developing its own case-law in this area and tending towards Wild West-style deregulation , for the simple reason that the legislature is inert ; it is doing nothing to address the areas where we lack harmonisation .
It is high time that the legislature acted , instead of handing all responsibility over to the Court of Justice .
One final point : the European Commission 's monopoly on initiative does not exist in a vacuum .
Like any monopoly , it has to be seen in a context and , in this case , the context follows from the Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreements .
According to those texts , both the Council and the European Parliament have an indirect right of initiative .
The Commission , in the Interinstitutional Agreements , has undertaken to respond to their proposals .
That being so , I wish to make it very clear that if the Commission fails to deliver a substantive response on this issue within the stipulated time limit , I shall propose to the Committee on Legal Affairs that we take proceedings against it in the European Court for failure to act .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I welcome the Commissioner 's remarks , particularly as commitment to better regulation involves clear team work of regulators and those people affected working together to develop a piece of legislation .
I also welcome that he is clear that there have to be economic objectives and that has to reflect market needs .
Looking through the Commission 's own summary of this consultation on company law , I notice that less than half the respondents call for the adoption of a European private company statute .
That seems to be slightly at odds with some of the statements we have heard so far , so perhaps he could clarify exactly what those responses were .
I also notice that most people wanted a codification and consolidation of existing company law , rather than anything going further .
Clearly , he has got quite a difficult balancing act .
What I want to know is : to what extent have we identified so far a clear need for legislation at a European level , as opposed to a domestic one ?
I suspect that , in some cases , the pressure is coming from those who have very complex domestic laws and who want a European law to simplify matters .
However , the problem is we have a European law on top of domestic laws and we often find it makes life much more complicated .
Surely , the whole object of this exercise is simplification and clarification .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , when I last spoke on this issue in February , I drew to the Commissioner 's attention the fact that I did not like all the recommendations in Parliament 's report , such as the size of the capital , because I felt that would make any statute along those lines discriminatory in favour of larger companies .
Therefore , I welcome the fact that in the Commissioner 's latest consultation , he is urging responses by SMEs .
However , we all need to be proactive in seeking those , with emphasis on the small rather than the medium .
I shall certainly be doing this within my region and I am pleased to say that there are other bodies within the UK doing likewise , so I welcome efforts to establish the relevance to small companies .
This is particularly the case when it is information from smaller companies that is frequently lacking , while , at the same time , we readily acknowledge that it is just those companies that do not have the means to deal with the different laws and regulations and , therefore , in theory at least it is those who we want to benefit most from the statute .
As I see it , this House has made some proposals that would render the statute unlikely to find favour with those very smaller companies , so there is a problem .
My message is to keep it simple otherwise , for small companies at least , it would just be a fig leaf for no change .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the competitiveness of companies and the efficiency of the internal market also require appropriate and up-to-date legal statutes for companies .
Some progress has been made in the case of large undertakings , with the adoption of the regulation on the European Private Company Statute on 8 October 2001 .
In 2004 , the European Commission opened up a discussion on a new form of European company , designed more specifically for small and medium-sized undertakings : the European Private Company .
That initiative was very warmly welcomed by all those who had been awaiting it for the past 30 years - yes , 30 years .
The results of the feasibility study on the Statute by the Commission were presented in December 2005 .
It clearly showed that the vast majority of the economic operators interviewed wanted such a statute , for two main reasons .
Firstly , the introduction of a European statute would have the advantage of removing obstacles to the establishment and mobility of SMEs in the European Union .
Secondly , it would enable a European label to be created for SMEs , particularly those in the new Member States .
For SMEs , the European Private Company seems an effective way of accessing the European market .
Its adoption would also indirectly contribute to the evolution and harmonisation of national law , which , in turn , encourages the development and integration of the European economy .
This new statute would meet the need to simplify the legal instruments available to companies and make them more effective .
It is my belief that many small and medium-sized undertakings would gain from such a statute , which would , obviously , remain optional .
The European Private Company plan is strongly supported in economic circles in virtually all the Member States .
That is certainly the case in France and Germany .
Parliament has approved the own-initiative report by Mr Lehne , whose conclusions I support , but at the moment no progress is being made .
That is why I am supporting the questions to the Commission from Mr Gargani , on behalf of JURI .
It is important to know what are the fundamental problems that have caused the Commission to delay its work on this issue .
Member of the Commission . - I wish to thank all Members for their comments .
I am afraid I cannot agree with Mr Gargani when he said that the Commission has not done anything and that it ignored Parliament .
When we discussed Parliament 's resolution on 1 February 2007 in Brussels , I undertook to answer Parliament in detail and I have every intention of living up to that commitment .
I also noted the request from a number of Members , during our debate on 1 February , not to ignore preparatory work .
Consultation on the EPC was duly launched in July .
There is some support amongst stakeholders for a European Private Company .
But it would be wrong to assume that there is consensus on its possible content , as both Mr Titley and Mrs Bowles have illustrated .
Jumping to a conclusion risks parking the proposal on the shelf before it even gets started .
The debate is closed .
Risk of closure of Gdansk shipyard ( debate )
The next item is the Commission statement on the risk of closure of the Gdansk shipyard .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am dealing with this file on behalf of my colleague , Mrs Kroes , the Competition Commissioner .
The Commission is not seeking the closure of Gdansk shipyard .
Gdansk shipyard has played a crucial part in European history and in the struggle for freedom and a reunited Europe .
We would like to see the yard undertaking a genuine far-reaching restructuring so as to become a successful company capable of competing on its own merits in the EU and world shipbuilding markets .
In the last decades , the shipbuilding industry has restructured all around Europe .
The Commission is well aware that for many yards and regions this has been a difficult process .
Many shipyards were closed and the shipbuilding capacity had to be reduced .
Wherever national State aid has been used for this restructuring , the Commission has had to exercise its responsibility under the Treaty to ensure that the level playing field among shipbuilders in the European Union was not distorted .
The Commission now has the same responsibility concerning its intervention in the Gdansk case .
The conditions under which State aid for ailing companies is compatible with the Treaty are clearly set out in the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulties .
The proper restructuring of Gdansk shipyard has been postponed for many years ; public money has not been used to create viable jobs , but to keep alive a company that would under normal market conditions have ceased to exist .
The Commission 's goals here are three-fold .
First , to ensure that the restructuring of Gdansk shipyard leads to its own long-term viability .
It could possibly mean scaling down its activities , but would eventually lead to the emergence of a smaller but more efficient shipyard capable of standing on its own feet .
Second , to limit the distortion of the level playing field and any harm to European competitors caused by State intervention , the yard 's production capacity has to be reduced .
Also , a significant contribution to the restructuring plan must be made from own resources , including the sale of assets that are not essential to the shipyard 's survival , or from external financing at market conditions .
Third , to ensure equal treatment .
Shipyards in other countries as well as other Polish shipyards , have had to reduce considerably their capacity .
Gdansk shipyard cannot be an exception .
Structural funds and other EU assistance have been used by other Member States to tackle the difficult transition period and to support the affected regions .
We have repeatedly reminded the Polish authorities of this possibility .
The Commission has been , and will remain , in close and constructive dialogue with the Polish authorities to seek a way forward in which the conditions for compatibility of the State aid are met and the State aid can be approved .
That process is ongoing .
Gdansk shipyard deserves a viable future by developing a new and sustainable position in the competitive shipbuilding industry of the EU .
I therefore believe that today 's debate will not be a political demonstration .
There is too much politics surrounding the Gdańsk shipyard .
To date it has been over-exploited politically .
I trust that this will be a step towards finding the best possible solutions .
I was a witness to and a modest participant in the collective elation in August 1980 which gave birth to Solidarity , subsequently a movement of 10 million people .
I know that there are among the 3 000 employees of the present shipyard people who at that time risked their lives in the name of human dignity , human rights and other values enshrined among the standards of the European Union .
They did so with courage but also prudence , and without resorting to violence .
Consequently , that approach , which did not involve the use of violence - an instrument of terror - may serve as a guide for us in the twenty-first century .
I would , of course , like the major centres of workers , the shipyards , the mines and the steelworks which formed the mainstay of Solidarity , to lend the shipyard 's cause infinitely greater support than isolated dissenting voices abroad , and I would like these centres to now become examples of economic success in the free market .
However , this will be very difficult , even impossible in the short term , as we can see from the experience of major centres of heavy industry in western Europe , which have taken entire decades to turn around economically .
This is the case in particular in the shipbuilding sector , which is faced with competition from the Far East , Korea , China and Vietnam , where low labour costs and , above all , a range of overt and covert forms of State intervention are decisive .
I would like the European Commission too to be aware of the complexity of the situation , because if it is not taken into account frustration will build up and a political populism will take root in our country .
I can understand the frustration of the shipyard workers who have a sense of what they are due historically and who , as they say , are confronted with soulless bureaucracy .
There is also frustration on the part of the European Commission which is dealing with an exceptionally spirited and recalcitrant establishment which would give many an authority a bloody nose .
I know that the workers at this shipyard should not be punished for the rather inappropriate , or simply clumsy , way these things have been handled by the present government .
I also know that the basis for agreement must be a long-term vision and not hastily drafted plans .
That long-term vision means an investor who will equip the shipyard with modern technology to replace the obsolete slipways currently at issue .
And I believe that today 's debate is a step in precisely that direction .
on behalf of the PSE group . - ( PL ) Mr President , it is appropriate that we are having a debate on the Gdańsk Shipyard .
There are two significant facts here : the first is that it is the anniversary of the signing of the Szczecin agreement of 30 August 1980 and the Gdańsk agreement of 31 August 1980 , and the second very significant fact is the present financial situation of the Gdańsk Shipyard .
The Gdańsk Shipyard is a symbol of the historical changes in Poland and also of the major changes that have occurred in Europe and internationally .
Here is where it began .
It is also the Gdańsk Shipyard that the leaders of the free world came to in the 1980s to encourage perseverance in the fight .
It is here too that people fought for human rights , freedom of expression , free trade unions , human dignity and development along the lines of the then European Economic Community .
It is therefore a living monument of which we should be proud , but it is also a shipyard - perhaps it is now primarily an undertaking producing ships .
The shipyard workers reminded us of this fact a week ago in Brussels .
They did not speak about historical dues but about economic matters , about their lives and their jobs .
Shipbuilding is a global industry .
Ships can easily be bought in Asia and do not necessarily have to be bought in Europe .
In view of what has just been said , Commissioner , in decisions concerning competitiveness we should not concentrate solely on so-called ' fair competition ' within the EU .
We need a global approach , that is to say we need to view the shipbuilding industry in the European Union within the global competitive environment and then consider all the conditions surrounding the operation of shipyards within the European Union , including the Gdańsk and Szczecin Shipyards .
The EU market rules are acceptable and accepted as a principle , but the way in which they are implemented and the relevant timetable must be realistic , and in particular must be addressed at individual entities .
Therefore , there may be certain doubts about privatisation as a means to an end - that is to say privatisation as an end which must be achieved by a certain date .
I therefore call on the Polish Government to work closely with the Commission , and on the shipyard management to manage this undertaking efficiently .
on behalf of the ALDE group . - ( PL ) Mr President , first of all I would like to say how pleased I am that the European Parliament is considering this matter today and how much I welcome this initiative .
I would like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for his statement today and to say that it is very important that we think of the European Union as a community .
On entering the European Parliament building we pass a statue , a sculpture , which states L 'Europe a un coeur - Europe has a heart .
Translated into political language , it denotes the strength of the European social model .
It is 27 years ago that the Gdańsk Shipyard workers launched their fight against the Communist system and for bread and freedom .
They wanted to restore the purpose of human labour and to liberate the economy from the State monopoly .
This historic shipyard is now faced with the dramatic European Commission recommendation that its production be reduced by two-thirds and that two slipways be closed in any event .
We consider that in this situation the following steps must be taken .
First , limit closure of the slipways to one and thus restore the shipyard 's chances of profitability .
Second , allow time to streamline the shipyard management , since the current management leaves much to be desired ( so that it becomes profitable and 3 000 workers do not lose their jobs ) .
Third , remember that the Gdańsk Shipyard stands as a major European memorial and testimony to the fact that social solidarity is one of the founding values of the European Union .
However , the European institutions cannot ignore this decision .
The pragmatism of our actions must go hand in hand with an understanding that we are building a Union for people and thanks to people .
Europe 's strength depends on our ability to be innovative and competitive but also sensitive to the fate of those who are weaker and less fortunate .
In my view , that is also the sense of the liberal message of freedom .
I would also like to mention a particular memory that I have : that of generations of Europeans in all countries of the European Union who wore the Solidarity badge on their lapels with pride and with hope .
There are such people in this Chamber .
Thus , they are the generation that is building European unity and should be aware of the historical significance of the Gdańsk Shipyard .
on behalf of the UEN group . - ( PL ) Mr President , I accompanied workers from the shipyard during their talks with Commissioner Kroes and Commissioner Špidla .
I was also with them when they appeared before the European Commission and appealed to Europe to help them .
The Gdańsk Shipyard is now emerging from its financial woes and beginning to operate at a profit .
It would be a great mistake if major financial restrictions were now to prevent it from making a profit and achieving success through the efforts of the people working there and us as a whole .
I would also like to emphasise the historical aspect .
We would not now be here as 27 countries in a united Europe , a Europe free of the threat of nuclear war , had it not been for Solidarity which was born in the Gdańsk Shipyard .
This is something that everyone needs to remember , including the politicians sitting here .
I would also like to point out that all those who have spoken on this matter so far and , I think , those who will do so later are completely unanimous in their views on this matter , regardless of their political differences .
This must be taken into account .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , I welcome the fact that my colleagues in the Conference of Group Presidents have agreed to my proposal to ask the Commission to make a statement to us before any decision is taken on the future of the Gdansk shipyards .
The Directorate-General for Competition did not need this new case to illustrate its thinking .
It has already attracted so much protest that many observers who can hardly be suspected of anti-liberalism have themselves regarded it as dogmatic for some time .
In this instance , a restructuring plan is only seen as convincing if it provides for 1 000 workers to be laid off .
There are plenty of previous examples of companies in difficulties being told to axe hundreds of jobs , failing which they will have to pay back the aid they need to survive .
In the present case , tell us what shipyard operates without subsidies .
I do not think there is any question that the award of subsidies has to be subject to conditions .
But the problem is that those conditions always involve heavy sacrifices for the workers .
In that respect , although the successive Competition Commissioners I have known are not usually noted for their soul-searching and social fibre is clearly not one of their attributes , this time the leading directorate-general of the Commission has gone even further by showing that it is as indifferent to political issues as to social problems .
By threatening the very existence of this place that is so emblematic of Poland , is the Commission considering the political implications of the message it is sending the people of this new Member State , barely three years after its accession ?
That is apparently the least of the worries of the guardians of free and undistorted competition .
They think there is a time to celebrate the key role of the Gdansk shipyard workers in the freedom struggle - a historic role , as Mr McCreevy said - and another time to impose the iron laws of the free market on them .
There is still time to stop this irresponsible action .
The first step , in my view , is to start substantive talks with the Polish trade unions , indeed with the European Federation of Metalworkers .
What is needed is to clarify the real amount of aid paid to these shipyards and , above all , to find a solution that avoids job losses .
The story of the Gdansk shipyards is a reminder that a political structure that proves unable to face up to its own contradictions and progress beyond them is doomed .
That lesson is still just as relevant today and some European leaders would do well to reflect on it .
on behalf of the IND / DEM group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the closure of two of the three slipways at Gdańsk Shipyard proposed by the European Commission and the possibility of having to reimburse State aid is a great mistake .
It fails to take account of several factors , including previous actions detrimental to the shipyard on the part of political wreckers and dishonest businessmen eager to get their hands on property and land in the city centre .
The dishonest privatisation of the shipyard is currently the subject of legal proceedings .
The Commission has no reliable knowledge about this .
Restructuring of the shipyard has already been carried out , thousands of workers have been laid off , and seven of the ten slipways have been closed down .
At present the shipyard is achieving positive financial results .
The closure of two slipways would destroy that gain and that achievement .
The enormous State aid that shipyards have received in the old Member States has bypassed the Gdańsk Shipyard .
This does not create a level playing field for competition and also takes no account of the differences in the methods used to calculate the profitability of shipyards .
This blow to the Gdańsk Shipyard also weakens the shipbuilding industry of the European Union as a whole .
I would remind you that the EU 's share of international shipbuilding is three times smaller than that of South Korea alone , which subsidises its shipbuilding industry .
This demonstrates the Commission 's lack of concern about the EU 's long-term economic interests .
The Commission 's intentions are contrary to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
The Gdańsk shipworkers fought for solidarity , which does not involve the brutal elimination of competitors .
Solidarity is not an empty slogan or compassion but responsibility and fairness and facing up to the truth .
Is the European Union capable of such values today ?
( PL ) Mr President , the Gdańsk Shipyard has particular significance for Poland .
It is not only a work establishment but also a political symbol .
In Communist times an attempt was made to destroy it .
The political engagement of the workforce and the support of the entire nation meant that the then authorities were unable to shut it down .
The workforce is conscious of the particular significance of the Shipyard and is responding to threats as they did then - by means of protest .
It would be terrible if an establishment which defended itself against Communist power should collapse under pressure from European Union directives .
It is absolutely essential that the establishment remains a shipyard and that it forms part of the shipbuilding industry and no other .
The reduction in the number of slipways from three to one , proposed by the Commission , would deprive it of its long-term profitability as a shipbuilder .
It needs at least two slipways in order to continue operating profitably as a shipyard .
Poland complies with the financial rules in force , but we know that shipbuilding is not such a sensitive sector of the EU economy that aid for the Gdańsk Shipyard might distort competition .
The Commission must take account of the special character of the Gdańsk Shipyard and give it special treatment .
As a symbol of the fight for independence from Communist power , the Gdańsk Shipyard must remain a shipyard .
( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , the Gdańsk Shipyard is a great European symbol , the place where in August 1988 Polish workers led by Lech Wałęsa began a strike for freedom and justice .
The shipyard became a symbol of the fight for trade union , political and civil rights for the workers ' movement throughout the world .
I would like to underline the importance of the initiative by Mr Wurtz which has made it possible to hold a debate on the risk of the collapse of the Gdańsk Shipyard in the European Parliament today .
I first spoke out in defence of the Gdańsk Shipyard while still an activist in underground ' Solidarity ' in November 1998 , when the government of Mieczysław Rakowski placed the shipyard into liquidation on the pretext of poor economic results .
Unfortunately , the Gdańsk Shipyard also became a symbol of the decline of heavy industry and the defencelessness of workers and trade unions in the face of that process , a model example of everything that is defined as ' casino capitalism ' .
Little remains of the proud shipyard that was the birthplace of ' Solidarity ' .
After 1989 the Solidarity government was unconcerned by the fate of the shipyard .
The establishment became a place of market speculation , on the one hand , and demagogy and populism , on the other .
Following entry into the European Union Polish shipyards received State aid .
The Gdańsk Shipyard started to restructure and is demonstrating that it can operate profitably .
The current demands by the European Commission for the closure of two of the three slipways used by the shipyard to build ships will make it unprofitable and result in unemployment and tragedy for many workers ' families .
In the European Parliament , on the twenty-seventh anniversary of the signing of the August agreements , I would urge prudence in this case .
Commissioner , let us consider a wise compromise which would reconcile the principles of the Single Market , which the Commission upholds , with the interests of three thousand shipyard workers .
Let us save the Gdańsk Shipyard !
( PL ) Mr President , when it talks about the Gdańsk Shipyard the Commission forgets , in all its pragmatism , a matter much more important than money , namely history .
Had it not been for the Shipyard , neither I nor many other Members from Central and Eastern Europe would be here today .
Had it not been for the changes initiated at the Shipyard the whole of Europe would look very different today - a Europe built on values such as democracy , freedom , equality and respect for human rights , the fight for which is symbolised by the Gdańsk Shipyard .
It was the strikes at that shipyard that began the dismantling of Communism .
To find a symbol of the European Union we need look no further than the place where we are and remember that in the name of post-war reconciliation between two nations we are able to spend over EUR 200 million a year on the monthly move to Strasbourg .
Why not also give financial support to the Gdańsk Shipyard , which symbolises the end of the Cold War and the liberation of the whole of Central and Eastern Europe from the yoke of Communism ?
I therefore make this appeal : let us not allow the Shipyard to collapse , let us not destroy the birthplace of ' Solidarity ' , and let us not measure the historical value of the Shipyard in euros .
Mr President , Commissioner , you have yourself recognised the very important political symbolism of the Gdańsk shipyards and all that they evoke .
But , of course , the shipyards are more than simply that symbolism .
They are the cornerstone of a whole regional economy , directly and indirectly providing thousands of jobs .
The closure or the running-down of the Gdańsk shipyard could devastate the whole regional economy , destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of people .
Commissioner , you have spoken about the importance of competition , the importance of the free market .
I would like to hear you speak about the importance of those jobs .
I would like to see you recognise the strategic importance of this shipyard for Poland - and , indeed , of this industry for the European Union as a whole .
I think this controversy lays bare , once again , rules on state aid and exactly where EU policy is directed .
I think it would be ironic and almost tragic if the demise of Gdańsk and all that it symbolises was due to the heavy hand of EU policy , which is wedded to the dynamic of competition , the market economy - to the exclusion of all else , it seems to me .
( PL ) Mr President , no one denies that the rules of the Single Market and competition are the driving force behind the European economy which guarantees its swift development .
Work establishments which do not face up to this challenge will have difficulties , including liquidation , and it is obvious that the employees of those establishments will protest .
However , last week 's protest by Polish shipyard workers must be viewed differently .
They did not come to Brussels to complain in order to arouse sympathy or ask for money .
They wanted to protest against a decision which they considered to be another death sentence on their shipyard , and will put at least a thousand workers on the street .
So what is the issue as far as they are concerned ?
To the shipyard workers who were in Brussels the issue is one of a level playing field and ensuring that the Commission decision is based on reliable , verified information , because reality shows that the shipyard is getting off the ground and that it finally has a chance of being a profitable undertaking .
EU law has allowed additional aid in similar situations .
We have examples set out in the Treaty when the eastern German Länder benefited from such aid .
I also want to emphasise that it was not a protest by the Polish government .
Those protesting were citizens of the European Union - shipyard workers with a right to do so , who organised themselves and came to draw our attention to the fact that something wrong is happening .
We should welcome that fact because that is how we build a civic society .
And one final thing : their presence in Brussels also demonstrates the fact that they have enormous trust in the European Union and that trust is expressed by Polish society as a whole .
Neither we nor the European Union should fail to live up to that trust .
( PL ) Mr President , last week a delegation of Polish shipyard workers came to Brussels to protest against the Commission 's decision to close down two slipways , which would result in mass lay-offs .
The shipyard workers believe that the Commission 's approach to their workplace is too rigorous and unfair .
After discussions with Commissioner Kroes and Commissioner Špidla the shipyard workers returned to Poland with high hopes .
The Commission should , as announced , undertake a further thorough review of the shipyard 's situation .
I would like to add that since Poland acceded to the European Union about a million people have left my country looking for work abroad , and this figure is continuing to increase .
If the European Commission sticks to its decision it will result in unavoidable redundancies for thousands of workers at the shipyard , who , at the present time , have been managing to hold their own in the competitive EU market .
There are some concerns about the partiality of the Commission and its support for another shipyard lobby .
I am sure it would be possible to find a satisfactory solution for both sides in the maze of often-contradictory regulations .
I would therefore like to add my name to the call to change the decision against the shipyard and to treat the Gdańsk Shipyard not just as an ordinary shipbuilding works , but also as a national and European symbol .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , may I just emphasise that the Commission understands the historic significance of the Gdańsk shipyard and the sensitivity of the case .
We all agree on the objective that the Gdańsk shipyard should be restructured to make it a viable yard .
This is the process that the Commission wants to encourage .
However , the Commission has the responsibility to do so while ensuring a level playing field in the European shipbuilding market and consistency in the treatment of companies under restructuring .
I would hope that the ongoing discussions between the Polish authorities and the Commission can lead to a satisfactory outcome .
The debate is closed .

Announcement by the President
Colleagues , as you can see , two new information screens have been installed in the Chamber .
They are larger and offer many more possibilities than the screens which have been replaced .
This is the first step in an ongoing project to improve the quality and the presentation of information concerning proceedings in the plenary , both for Members and the public .
In particular , after each roll-call vote , a graphic overview of the Chamber will be briefly displayed , showing voting patterns across the House .
This new feature , familiar in many national parliaments , merely reflects information which is in any case published in detail in the ' Results of Votes ' annex to the Minutes of the proceedings .
However , further to a decision by Parliament 's Bureau yesterday evening , the Conference of Presidents , in their sublime wisdom , will decide on Thursday if the group chairs wish to make use of this aspect of the system on a permanent basis in the future .
In the mean time , political groups were consulted this morning and agreed to permit the use of this graphic display on an experimental basis at our voting session this morning .

( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I had asked to speak on an issue connected with our work schedule : the fact that the new school year has coincided for some years , and will unfortunately coincide again next year , with our plenary poses major family problems for our Members and for many of our officials .
In my view , this is a question that Parliament should debate , because the well-being of our children , who should be taken to school by their parents , is a matter that it behoves this Parliament to address .
( Applause )
Thank you , Mrs Frassoni , I am sure you have a good point , but you were late for assembly , so see the headmaster , please !

( For the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
Explanations of vote
in writing . - ( PT ) We have here an initiative from the Republic of Finland , the aim of which is to adapt the rules on analysis files to the legislation in force .
In fact , the 2003 Protocol which entered into force in April this year modifies Title III of the Europol Convention and , particularly , the part relating to the creation of analysis files and the collection , processing , use and deletion of the personal data contained in such files .
This means that the implementing rules that were adopted will have to be amended accordingly .
This is therefore a measure which , though temporary , is necessary and appropriate .
In fact , the measure will be in force for a limited period , as all previous legislation will be repealed when the Council Decision establishing a European Police Office enters into force .
( DE ) Mr President , I voted for this resolution but there is one point that I should like to highlight - the reference to the creation of a European protection force .
We have a tendency , here in the European Parliament , to react to specific events by calling immediately for the creation of a new institution or the establishment of a new position .
In this case , the point must be clearly made , once again , that responsibility for dealing with natural disasters simply cannot and should not be taken out of the Member States ' hands : on the contrary , it is primarily their responsibility , and it lies within their authority , to take preventive measures and to ensure that fire services have the best possible equipment and training so that they can combat disasters effectively .
In exceptional cases only , in the event of extreme catastrophe , there will of course also be recourse to support and solidarity from the European Union , which will be asked to step in .
The primary responsibility , however , must remain with the Member States .
( DE ) Mr President , I voted in favour of the resolution on natural disasters because it has been demonstrated yet again that Europe is not invulnerable in these extreme situations and that it needs the solidarity of the EU .
One thing must be clear , however : greatly improved coordination is needed and the situation should not be allowed to arise where EU Member States need additional assistance from third countries because we are not in a position to provide the necessary help ourselves .
The challenge for the Member States is to develop better organised aid structures , particularly where volunteers are used , for example by providing the best possible training and equipment for fire brigades .
The disposal of dead pets and wild animals is a major problem that needs to be tackled as soon as possible , both to prevent the risk of outbreaks of disease and also to reduce environmental damage .
( DE ) Mr President , I too voted for the resolution , although it is my opinion that these dreadful forest fires should not be allowed to cause further bloating of the EU institutions .
As I see it , neither a European civil protection agency nor a European disaster intervention force will be capable of affording effective protection against natural disasters in the European Union .
They are more likely to produce increased red tape and increased costs .
What we need to do , therefore , is to improve international cooperation in order to be prepared for future natural disasters , and we need to maintain our fire services and also our woods and forests sufficiently well so that future disasters simply do not occur on this scale .
Mr President , I have to say that in my own Group 's voting list this resolution on natural disasters is described as forest fires , but the natural disasters in Europe over the summer were actually wider than that and I wish to raise the issue in my own region of the worst floods in over a century .
A third of a million people were without drinking water for more than a week .
4 000 homes were severely damaged and tens of thousands forced to evacuate at a total cost of EUR 150 million .
I am hoping that my government will apply for assistance from the European Commission to enable the county and the towns in my region and elsewhere in Britain to actually get some recompense for the costs that are inevitably going to fall on very narrow sections of the population .
The title of the motion for a resolution is ' natural disasters ' and it has been corrected .
Mr President , I just want to echo what Mr Ford said about the natural disasters in the UK .
People may not be aware , but 40 000 residential properties were flooded .
Nine hundred schools have been affected .
Mainline railway lines are still closed .
Agricultural land has been affected , including 75 % of the pea crop in the UK .
In my own region of Yorkshire and the Humber , many thousands of people were affected and many are still unable to return to their properties .
What we want from the Commission , given that the UK Government has now applied for solidarity funding , is a rapid response to that application , but at the same time we need all the EU institutions to make climate change a top priority .
When we have a major piece of legislation coming through this House in the next few months , I hope that colleagues will bear in mind the natural disasters of this summer and make sure that we make our contribution to tackling the long-term issue of climate change , and I hope there will be no more of these natural disasters on the scale we have seen this summer .
Mr President , I too want to support the application for funds from the European Commission .
My region , the South-East of England region , suffered equally badly , especially in Oxfordshire and parts of Berkshire , and my colleague Mr Hannan and I have made an application to the European Commission for emergency funds .
The reason I am standing up now is to ask the Commission to expedite the funding of relief and the restoration to normality of my region , the South-East of England .
in writing . - ( FR ) In voting for the resolution on the natural disasters that have occurred this summer , I wanted to express my solidarity with the families of the victims and those living in the devastated regions .
This is also a message of thanks to all the professionals , volunteers and local authorities that helped to fight the fires and rescue the flood victims .
I believe that there is now an urgent need to put emergency Community aid measures , especially financial measures , in place to help regenerate the regions where there has been severe damage .
We also need to restore the productive potential of the areas affected , try to encourage the creation of more jobs and take appropriate steps to offset the social costs arising from the loss of jobs and other sources of revenue .
I am still concerned at the increasing number of disasters caused by extreme weather conditions , which experts believe are largely due to the climate change that is causing global warming .
I therefore urge the Commission to take steps to guarantee compliance with the Kyoto commitments and their repercussions .
in writing . - While supporting and voting for the Joint Motion for a Resolution on Natural Disasters , British Conservatives have misgivings about the creation of a " European force " ( paragraph 9 ) since we believe that both prevention and rapid reaction capabilities should be concentrated on the resources of the Member States .
in writing . - ( PT ) We consider this resolution to be a good one and we propose to vote for it , but we must draw attention to the absence of any important proposals ( despite several references to previous EP resolutions ) and the insistence on others about which we have major doubts .
Thus , we must insist on the need to review the Solidarity Fund regulation to cover regional disasters , create mechanisms to support the people affected and assist reforestation , with due attention to the prevention of major disasters caused by climate change .
There should be a public agricultural insurance scheme , financed by the European Union , to guarantee farmers a minimum income in situations of public emergency such as droughts , fires and floods .
It is essential to opt for a policy of prevention to address the problem of natural disasters particularly affecting the Mediterranean area , and to introduce radical changes in the CAP to combat the decline in small and medium-sized farms and family farms by encouraging agricultural production , biodiversity and occupation of the land .
We have doubts about the Community civil protection mechanism because it may turn out to be yet another way of removing important aspects of national sovereignty , such as the management of natural resources , particularly forest and woodland .
in writing . - ( PL ) For some years now we have been opening the autumn session of Parliament with discussions of the tragic consequences of natural disasters that affect Europe in the summer .
Droughts , heat waves , floods and fires are devastating Europe .
When we add to this the industrial catastrophes caused by forces of nature , then we see a picture of Europe whose citizens stand helplessly before the destructive power of nature .
Over 60 people died this year in the fires in Greece , many families lost everything they owned , and thousands of hectares of forests and olive-groves went up in smoke .
This is a truly tragic picture .
I know what such a tragedy means .
My own country has been affected by floods and we have had many victims of tragic mining accidents .
For this reason I would like to offer my sympathy and European solidarity to the families and loved ones of the victims of the Greek disaster as well as to the inhabitants of regions affected by the fires .
At the same time , I do not think that Europe can afford to be passive in the face of such events .
This does not just mean EU financial assistance that will make it possible to rebuild the regions affected by disasters .
First of all , we must prepare a more effective prevention and early warning mechanism within the EU , which , even if it does not make it possible to avoid disasters , would certainly have an impact on reducing their effects .
Even though the protection of the population against disasters is the responsibility of every State , we should think about a more effective monitoring of national crisis control policies , and perhaps even about a joint rapid reaction force in the event of such disasters .
in writing . - ( PT ) I should like to express our deepest sorrow for the victims of the serious forest fires in the spring - particularly in Greece - and our solidarity with their families and with all those affected .
Deeds , not words , are needed now .
The EU must activate the necessary financial instruments and means to meet the material needs of the people affected and to promote the social , economic and environmental recovery of the regions involved .
In the light of the points raised so far , I recall some of the proposals which we presented in 2003 and 2005 and which remain as relevant as ever :
Maintain the eligibility of regional disasters for aid under the Solidarity Fund ;
Recognise natural disasters specifically affecting the Mediterranean area where more than 90 % of forest fires and drought are recorded ;
Create a Community programme for the protection of forest and woodland against fire ;
Examine the possibility of creating an agricultural disaster fund ;
Pay special attention to the least-favoured regions in the event of natural disasters .
Lastly , I should like to point out that if the funds allocated to ever-increasing military appropriations were spent instead on preventing and combating natural disasters and on recovery in the areas affected , the incidence and consequences of such disasters would be significantly reduced .
in writing . - ( FR ) At the end of August , Greece experienced its worst natural disaster ever .
The first partial toll of the huge fires that swept through large areas of the Peloponnese was 63 dead , over 40 000 head of cattle burnt to death , 250 000 olive trees burnt and hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest gone up in smoke .
The three days of national mourning announced by the Prime Minister , Kostas Karamanlis , cannot cover up for the total failure of the State to protect its citizens and come to the aid of villagers surrounded by flames , in a country where scorching summers and fire risks are a common occurrence .
Everywhere there was evidence not just of undermanning and equipment shortages , but also of the failure to plan ahead and to coordinate operations .
Like the previous PASOK governments , the New Democracy government did nothing to prevent the scale and horror of the fires .
With a total lack of scruple and for purely political reasons , the Prime Minister announced , even as the fires were breaking out all over Greece , that the general elections would take place as planned .
In support of the Greeks who have suffered as victims of their politicians , let us hope that in future irresponsible governments will be replaced by responsible governments .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the resolution on the summer 's natural disasters and particularly welcome the existence of the EU 's Solidarity Fund , which is available to help Member States deal with the aftermath of such disasters .
It is a useful expression of solidarity that genuinely helps EU countries and citizens in moments of great need .
in writing . - ( IT ) The terrible fires which struck Greece and southern Italy in particular this summer , leaving victims in their wake and destroying thousands of hectares of woodland and agricultural land , again highlight the urgent need for better coordination of rapid reaction measures by Member States ' civil protection forces .
To that end , it is now clear that a European Civil Protection Agency needs to be set up to coordinate and manage measures to eradicate or prevent the causes of disasters .
It has to be stressed that disasters may be supranational in nature , and Europe should not just rely solely on the generosity of volunteers or on the competences and resources of the particular State that has been affected , but should have enough human and financial resources and appropriate equipment to enable swift action to be taken .
in writing . - ( PT ) For the sake of consistency , in view of what we have said in the past and what we expect from the European Solidarity Fund , I shall clearly be voting for this resolution .
But this vote is not just about consistency .
European integration , among countless other advantages , has the advantage of scale and the economies of scale that come with solidarity .
Without in any way diminishing the responsibilities of Member States and their governments , it is possible and desirable through an effort of solidarity at European level to face the disasters that are caused by nature and its increasing unpredictability rather than by any mistakes in the management of the land .
However , while insisting on this point , we cannot leave the human factor out of account , when a criminal starts a fire or when a plan for the land opens the way for such disasters or exacerbates their consequences .
I therefore believe it is time to review many of our policies , particularly in the area of forest and woodland management and rural development but not only in that area : we also need to look at our environmental measures , so as to prevent Man from becoming even more destructive than the destructive force of Nature .
in writing . - ( FR ) Over 60 dead and 184 000 hectares of land gone up in smoke : that is the toll of the fires that swept through Greece at the end of August .
Europe was not a passive observer .
Solidarity came fully into play through the ' European rapid reaction instrument ' that we voted for last March , a joint civil protection system in which 30 States make resources such as Canadairs , tankers and qualified personnel ( ' green berets ' ) available to countries suffering man-made or natural disasters .
I am not fanatical about the systematic transfer of competences to Europe , but I do believe that a Community civil protection system is worthwhile , because natural disasters know no borders .
I have said so several times in this House , especially at the time of the disastrous fires in Portugal in 2003 .
The European Union urgently needs to demonstrate its benefits .
It must serve as a model , so that there is solidarity between all the citizens of Europe , and not just in this particular disaster .
in writing . - ( FR ) The catastrophic storm in December 1999 , floods in Central Europe in 2002 , fires in Portugal and Spain in 2004 , and now fires in Greece in which people have lost their lives , and also in Romania and Bulgaria : each time there is a strong emotional response , each time Europe sympathises , each time the Commission promises to improve its solidarity and its aid mechanisms .
Right here , on 18 January 2000 in fact , I called for the creation of a public safety Eurocorps , and the idea was taken up by Commissioner Barnier in his May 2006 report .
Right here in this Parliament , we have called in vain for the renewal of the 1992 regulation under which funding would be provided for fire-prevention equipment such as firebreaks , access roads and monitoring systems .
Now we must not wait for the next disaster , for more victims .
Let us put the Barnier proposal into practice .
There is a military Eurocorps .
Surely Europe can set up a public safety Eurocorps for itself , to protect its citizens against natural and accidental risks ?
Then we should ask Member States to draw up plans to prevent forest fires and help them , encourage them , to finance these through a specific financing instrument similar to that in the old 1992 regulation .
When we are facing climate change , it is in the interests of the whole of Europe to introduce ambitious prevention policies .
( SK ) As far as the regions are concerned , given that their role in the legislative process means that they are often directly responsible for implementing and enforcing EU law , the efforts to achieve better regulation are extremely important .
Bodies at different levels of national and local government , economic and social partners , representatives of civil society and non-governmental organisations must - as far as possible - participate actively in the consultation process on European law-making .
Equally important is their role in the assessing the influence and effect of this legislation on the Member States .
This will increase the quality , clarity and transparency of the regulations being prepared , while taking account of local and regional conditions and differences .
In this way we will also prevent wrong interpretations as well as delays in the transposition and implementation of legislation .
( SK ) Within the scope of my parliamentary mandate I come across citizens ' complaints that during the transposition of EU legislation some Member States impose on them obligations that go beyond the requirements of the laws in question .
The citizens are afflicted by needless administrative burdens that make them antipathetic towards the EU legislation that is being adopted .
I voted in favour of the report on better regulation in the European Union , which incorporated my amendments , as it presents a great opportunity to approach European legislation from a new angle .
European laws are drafted with the aim of simplifying the lives of EU citizens and are not meant to burden them ; that is why they have to be drafted in a simple and intelligible way , with the emphasis on quality not quantity .
At the same time , if the relevant parties at all levels are informed about the transposition of EU legislation efficiently and in time , this will ensure that the citizens have greater confidence in the European project .
in writing . - I voted for this report on better regulation in the EU .
I strongly support regulation being done in a least-cost and most efficient way , to help the development of a more competitive European economy and deliver better social , environmental and economic outcomes at the same time .
in writing . - British Conservatives believe it is unfortunate that paragraph three appears vague in seeming to support " any " initiative in the enforcement of Community law .
British Conservatives support the enforcement of Community law but wish to analyse and consider any initiative proposed by the Commission .
Otherwise , we believe that this report is an excellent exposition .
in writing . - I voted for this report on how EU law- and regulation-making can best be done .
More effective and streamlined regulatory and legal frameworks will deliver EU-wide improvements in social and economic outcomes , generate more jobs and improve our quality of life .
in writing . - ( PT ) The report states that simplifying the legislative environment to ensure the clarity , efficacy and quality of legislation is an essential prerequisite for attaining the objective of better law-making which , in turn , is a priority for the European Union .
In the meantime , it states that some 500 new legislative initiatives ( 200 of which in 2007 alone ) have been included in a separate rolling programme specifically dedicated to codifications , showing the bureaucratic complexity of the European Union .
It also notes that the simplification being promoted at European level should be accompanied by appropriate simplification at national level to ensure that the advantages of Community simplification are not undermined by national rules or technical barriers .
However , a distinction must be made between purely bureaucratic matters and cases where rights may be called into question .
We agree with the proposal that the Commission once and for all adopt recasting as a standard legislative technique so that , for each initiative , the text can be available in its entirety , also where there are specific amendments , providing a clear indication of the new parts and those which are unchanged , thereby increasing the legibility and transparency of Community legislation .
in writing . - I voted for this resolution on better regulation .
As a socialist , I have no difficulty in putting further burdens on industry to protect health and safety , the environment or raise the minimum wage .
Yet I want value for money .
The End of Vehicle Life Directive that came into force some years ago was estimated by the British Cabinet Office to have cost the economy GBP 400 million ( EUR 590 million ) while providing environmental and social benefits at a level of GBP 100 million ( EUR 150 million ) per annum .
If these figures are anything like accurate , this directive was a political and environmental failure .
We want costs to industry ( and society ) where there is a large multiplier as to benefits with costs of GBP 100 million providing EUR 500 million in benefits .
Implementing the recommendations for in future cost benefit analysis of proposed legislation will do exactly that .
in writing . - ( SV ) We believe that traditional legislation and the open method of coordination can live side-by-side and that both are still needed .
We do not therefore share the view that the open method of coordination must be used only in exceptional cases .
It should also continue to be used when harmonisation is not desirable or practicable .
We do , however , share the view that the European Parliament should participate more fully when the open method of coordination is used .
in writing . - British Conservatives support the broad thrust of the Medina Ortega report , which sets clear boundaries on the promotion and use of Community law .
Concerning paragraph 18 , we wish to make it clear that Conservatives do not support closer European integration but share the view that there is a current mistrust relating to the EU institutions which these proposals may help to alleviate .
in writing . - ( PT ) We agree with the rapporteur that the notion of non-binding legal instruments ( soft law instruments ) based on common practice is ambiguous and pernicious and should not be used in any documents of the Community institutions , although we disagree with other points in the report .
Such soft law instruments , which can legitimately be used as interpretative or preparatory tools for binding legislative acts , should neither be treated as legislation nor be given any norm-setting effectiveness , and it is for each country to decide on their use , in particular where they cast light on the interpretation of national measures adopted to implement them or where they are designed to supplement binding Community provisions .
Clearly , so-called non-binding legal instruments cannot be a substitute for legal acts and instruments , which are available to ensure the continuity of the legislative process .
The Commission must therefore give special consideration to the effect of soft law on consumers and their possible means of redress before proposing any measure involving soft law instruments .
in writing . - ( CS ) This report is very important in the context of improving and simplifying the Community 's legal environment .
I would particularly like to stress its importance with regard to the need to strengthen the European Parliament 's role in the legislative process and its importance in terms of eliminating the democratic deficit .
I also fully support the desire to establish methods of consultation with the European Parliament on the adoption of so-called non-binding legal acts , especially since these acts are fairly common : they often earn attributes such as ' unclear ' and ' inefficient ' , and their excessive use may be a manifestation of exceeding the scope of the Commission 's .
In addition , the public may identify the image of European ' superbureaucracy ' with these acts .
Although the report recommends that soft law should not be used in official Community documents and that the distinction between dura lex and mollis lex should not be recognised , I do not consider this to be a relevant issue .
The difference between binding and non-binding acts of the Community is a matter of fact and this recommendation does not change either the reality of their existence or their essence .
In addition , the fact that the soft rules of secondary Community law are not legally binding does not mean that they have no legal value .
Think , for example , of their importance in the interpretation of legal acts .
Furthermore , if a Community body does not issue a recommendation or does not express an opinion in cases where it is obliged to do so , it can be accused of being passive .
However , this last comment is a technical one and does not detract from the report as a whole .
( PL ) Mr President , today we approved a report in which we carried out a review of the functioning of the European Union 's common market .
The common market , which consists of the free movement of persons , services , capital and goods , has encouraged significant economic growth , increased employment and improved competitiveness in the European economy .
However , to improve its functioning , existing barriers and unnecessary regulation should be abolished .
It is still the case , unfortunately , that some countries restrict the movement of workers from the new Member States .
It is also important to inform our citizens , investors and businessmen about the benefits and opportunities presented by the common internal market .
A unified market , without boundaries or restrictions , is the fundamental pillar of the European Union .
The common market brings our whole community closer together and binds us together , introducing transparent principles for competition and encouraging the growth of entrepreneurship .
The common market must , however , take into account social cohesion , employment issues , protection for the environment and for the consumer .
A particularly important issue are measures to reduce the administrative burden in the European Union .
Mr President , paragraph 16 of the Toubon report regrets that insufficient emphasis was placed on the potential contribution of nuclear power .
My vote against this phrase is on the assumption that it was referring to nuclear fission , with which I and many others have a problem in terms of the disposal of radioactive waste and the legacy of decommissioning .
Any emphasis on the potential contribution from nuclear fusion , however , while still some way in the future , would deserve support .
Paragraph 32 refers to harmonisation in the area of taxation , amongst others , and also urges the Commission to push ahead with its proposals concerning a common consolidated corporate tax base .
The Irish delegation of the PPE-DE Group is firmly opposed to any harmonisation of direct taxation , including corporate taxation , and we will continue to reject any proposals which weaken that position .
So , despite many excellent points in the Toubon report , my colleagues and I had to abstain .
in writing . - ( SV ) We consider that the report has a well-balanced view of the internal market and in particular welcome the provisions on the social and environmental impact assessments which must form the basis of new policy initiatives .
We do not , however , share the view on the contribution of nuclear power and believe that the report is unclear on tax matters .
For example , we are uncertain about the initiatives that the Commission must take as regards excise duties and VAT and point out that tax levels fall within the competence of the Member States .
We are also uncertain about which trade defence measures are referred to in the report .
Even though we had wished to see stronger provisions on social clauses , we have voted in favour of the report as a whole because we welcome the review and the broad thrust of the report .
in writing . - The first 10 years of the internal market added EUR 877 billion to the EU economy .
It helped to create 2.5 million jobs .
These facts speak for themselves that the single market is working .
As a trading nation , Ireland can only benefit from a fully functioning single market .
Ensuring competitiveness is a vital element in the policy mix of a fully functioning single market .
I do not accept that the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base ( CCCTB ) will not hamper EU competitiveness as proposed in the Toubon report .
The CCCTB is the backdoor to tax harmonisation .
It is vital that Member Sates have the flexibility to use taxation in different ways and at different rates to achieve their social and economic objectives - tax harmonisation would prevent this .
The Toubon report contains many favourable points with regard to the knowledge society for a sustainable EU , for an EU open to the world and for a well-regulated EU .
However , I abstained on the final vote because I firmly believe that the EU is best served by promoting tax competition , not tax harmonisation .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted against the report on the Single Market Review : tackling barriers and inefficiencies through better implementation and enforcement .
I do not agree with the approach by the rapporteur , Mr Toubon , in which opening up to competition in the Single Market would not be subject to any limits or social regulation .
I also voted against the further liberalisation of the postal service advocated in the report and I am sorry that the amendments on social and fiscal harmonisation were rejected .
Furthermore , I deplore the new reference to the introduction of an unrestricted transatlantic single market and stress that priority should be given to safeguarding and promoting the European social model .
In my opinion , completion of the Single Market should be regulated by guarantees of social protection for the citizens of Europe , which is not proposed in the Toubon report , the only European Parliament contribution to the Single Market Review .
in writing . - ( FR ) The French Socialists have voted in favour of the Toubon report on the Single Market Review and its adaptation to the twenty-first century , since it refers to important aspects that are sometimes ignored when discussing the completion of the Single Market .
Thus social and territorial cohesion and up-to-date services of general interest go hand in hand with the completion of the Single Market .
We have , nonetheless , voted against paragraph 24 on the liberalisation of postal services .
The report also lays emphasis on consumer protection , which is closely linked to the completion of the European Single Market and has to be guaranteed .
Lastly , the environmental aspect has to be included in the requirements for the internal market , which is an asset for the European Union provided that those general principles are observed .
One important point in the report is SMEs and facilitating their access to the European internal market as a whole , in view of the vital role that they and the craft industries play in European employment and innovation .
I particularly support the determination expressed by the rapporteur to take active and effective steps against counterfeiting , which is a real plague on the European economy .
in writing . - ( PT ) This report has a very strong neoliberal bias , showing once again that the European Parliament is bent on ever more liberalisation , more returns on capital for business and financial groups that are already recording profits of 35 % or more .
So , after a eulogy on the great benefits that the Single Market delivers ( to big business and financial groups ) , we are told that there are still protectionist attitudes and that it is essential to combat them and to move forward in other areas , such as financial services , tax policy , transport , postal services and energy , which are not yet fully liberalised and integrated .
By distorting reality , they seek to mask the real effects of the Single Market , such as the increase in costs , the reduction in services and the quality of services , the job losses , to name but a few .
This report is an attempt to encourage further liberalisation of public services , further transfers of political power from national to transnational level , and further attacks on consumers ' and workers ' rights , and we must therefore vote against it .
in writing . - ( SV ) The June List shares the rapporteur 's general position , that the internal market is one of the EU 's greatest success stories and that it must be further developed and improved .
We are opposed , however , to many of the specific proposals made in the report .
We strongly oppose the provisions on tax harmonisation , the welcome given to the euro , and the need for the Member States to liberalise postal services , which are a public service to be regulated first and foremost by each Member State .
Lastly , we agree that the legal situation as regards services of general interest is unclear .
We have chosen to vote against Amendment 12 / rev tabled by the PPE-DE and Amendment 4 tabled by the PSE , however , because the long-term result of the provision made in those amendments will be that further power is transferred to the European Court of Justice .
On the basis of the above arguments , we have chosen to vote against the report in the final vote .
in writing . - British Conservatives have been at the forefront of the campaign to create a fully functioning and effective single market .
We welcome the Toubon report and its emphatic support for continued action in making the single market dynamic , outward-looking and flexible , while at the same time ensuring that it delivers real benefits for citizens .
In that context , British Conservatives have argued that tax policy must remain under the complete control of EU Member States , and that ' one size fits all ' policies at EU level threaten the economic dynamism and global competitiveness that are so critical to Europe 's future .
We have therefore voted against calls for a common consolidated corporate tax base .
in writing . - ( SV ) Even though the report includes some positive provisions I have chosen to vote against it .
Aside from the provisions on nuclear power which I cannot support , the report criticises excise duties and minimum harmonisation in consumer affairs , which could in future have negative repercussions for both Swedish alcohol policy and consumer protection .
I welcome the review but wanted to see stronger provisions on social clauses and I believe that the report is not as balanced as it should have been .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted for the report by Mr Toubon on the Single Market Review and I support the positive approach of the rapporteur to one of the most important pillars of the European Union .
The four freedoms that make up the Single Market - the free movement of goods , services , persons and capital - must be further encouraged and developed to ensure that everyone benefits fully from the advantages of the Single Market .
As regards the free movement of services , I think it is a great pity that more emphasis has not been placed on the importance of the country of origin principle , which has already been severely undermined by the services directive , in the achievement of a real Single Market and in the creation of jobs .
I also believe that observance of the country of origin principle for VAT on distance selling and e-commerce is the only viable basis for a coherent and transparent tax framework to allow the free movement of goods .
In my view , tax competition is in no way an obstacle to the completion of the Single Market ; on the contrary , it encourages economic operators to defend their freedoms in regard to free movement within the Single Market .
in writing . - I voted in favour of this report on the Single Market Review which the Commission is working on .
In particular I welcome the focus on improving regulation throughout the Union , and the focus on providing legal certainty for services of general interest .
The Danish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen , Mrs Thomsen , Mrs Schaldemose , Mr Jørgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against paragraph 18 , which concerns the Commission 's review of the consumer acquis .
The delegation believes that minimum harmonisation is necessary whilst such great disparities remain in the level of consumer protection in the Member States .
The delegation also disagrees with paragraph 26 , which states that the present VAT and excise duty systems are a barrier to the completion of the Single Market .
The delegation believes that the wording , among other things , conflicts with the Danish system of excise duties .
However , the delegation wishes to emphasise its support for better implementation of the Single Market .
in writing . - I wish to explain that I cannot support paragraph 32 of the report , which calls for broad tax harmonisation , or the harmonisation of corporate taxes , nor recital O , which criticises these Member States that guard their prerogatives in regard to tax issues .
Member States must be free to determine their own taxation policy as part of national fiscal policy .
In regard to paragraph 40 , part 2 , I will vote in favour of this because I have concerns that on a number of issues Member States use EU legislation to ' gold plate ' their own national laws , and then blame the EU for any subsequent criticism that may come their way .
I will also vote for paragraph 16 , part 2 , which states insufficient attention has been given to nuclear energy as a tool with which to tackle climate change in a balanced way and would hope that as a result a discussion could start based on facts and not on fears with regard to the role that nuclear energy can bring to climate change as part of a well balanced energy policy .
in writing . - I voted against this report because amendments favouring tax harmonisation were passed and included in the report .
I am resolutely opposed to any measure favouring harmonisation of taxes across the EU .
There is a constant attempt to slip these measures in as amendments , and even in the body of reports , and I will oppose them at every opportunity .
The Commission should be more forthright about its intentions on this subject coming up to the referendum on the Reform Treaty .

Formal sitting - Portugal
Welcome to the European Parliament , Mr Cavaco Silva .
It is a great pleasure for the European Parliament to receive the President of the Portuguese Republic .
President of the Portuguese Republic . - ( PT ) Mr President of the European Parliament , Mr President of the European Commission , ladies and gentlemen ,
I should like to express my thanks to the President of the European Parliament for his kind words and my deep appreciation for the invitation to be here today .
It is an honour for me to have this opportunity to address you all , representatives of the peoples of Europe and members of this great European institution , the European Parliament .
I am well aware of the decisive role this Parliament has played in the successful process of European integration .
I have not forgotten the intense and fruitful collaboration with this institution in 1992 when , as prime minister , I led the first Portuguese Presidency of the Council whose motto , you may remember , was Towards European Union .
The European Parliament 's contribution was fundamental to the establishment of a strong internal market and to the progress of the project for European Union born of Maastricht .
Now , for the third time , my country holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union .
And , once again , we face great challenges .
Challenges that call for convergence in the political will of the Member States and the European institutions .
More than ever before , it is essential to concentrate our collective energies and determination on what is really needed to make Europe stronger and more cohesive .
This is ultimately what the citizens of Europe expect of their leaders .
The Portuguese Presidency will do everything in its power to establish the convergence that is indispensable to progress in the construction of Europe .
I trust , in particular , that we shall have the frank and open collaboration with the European Parliament that we had during the previous Portuguese Presidencies .
One of the Presidency 's priorities is to conclude the Reform Treaty based on the agreement reached at the June European Council .
An agreement which I regard as a very important step , one which I hope will enable us to move on from a period marked by a certain erosion of the process of European construction .
I therefore call for a concerted effort to ensure that the new Treaty is concluded during the Portuguese Presidency .
Once the negotiations are over and that chapter is closed , the European Union must concentrate with increased consistency and renewed confidence on the challenges that are of concern to the citizens of Europe : economic growth , employment , security , the environment , energy , and globalisation .
This is the agenda on which Europe is required to act , for our own and also for future generations .
It seems to me , therefore , that this is a good moment to stress the value of solidarity as a fundamental pillar in the construction of Europe .
Solidarity which is , in fact , a sine qua non for the future of European construction , on a par with the other truly fundamental principle , subsidiarity .
A solidarity that is tangible , practical , translated into policies and joint action , not a rhetorical , à la carte solidarity .
I take the liberty of recalling at this point the 1950 Schuman Declaration , and I quote , that Europe ... will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity .
We must continue to be guided by these words in our efforts to build a stronger and more cohesive Europe .
Loss of the idea of belonging to a Union based firmly on solidarity is one of the major risks of European integration .
To be a true Union , it is essential to retain the sense of Community that was , not without reason , the original name given to the construction of Europe .
One of the concrete achievements which created de facto solidarity was the concept of economic and social cohesion established in the Single European Act of 1986 , in connection with which I had the honour to participate in the negotiations and which I signed in my capacity as Prime Minister of Portugal .
The extraordinary progress of European integration in the past 20 years would not have been possible without economic and social cohesion policies .
They contributed to political cohesion , to economic growth , to employment , to territorial cohesion , to equal opportunities and to strengthening Europe 's standing in the world .
There are now fresh reasons for renewed interest in the principle of cohesion .
I am thinking of increasing globalisation , migration on a vast scale , and demographic developments leading to the social and economic imbalances associated with an aging population .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen ,
The three aspects of sustainable development are well known : social , economic , environmental .
This is a central objective of European integration , reaffirmed on various occasions and enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy .
I should like on this occasion to concentrate on the social aspect and more particularly on the subject of poverty and social exclusion .
The unequivocal identification of the battle against poverty and social exclusion as a European objective confers on all of us a responsibility for finding new solutions for increasingly complex and persistent problems .
The Social Agenda , combined with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy , sets out the ambitious and difficult challenge we face .
I note , in this connection , that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the creation of the European Social Fund and the 10th anniversary of the European Employment Strategy .
It is also the European Year of Equal Opportunities .
As President of the Portuguese Republic , I have chosen the subject of social inclusion as one of my priorities for action .
During the first year of my term in office , I promoted the Road to Inclusion to mobilise the Portuguese people and alert them to the urgent need to address the indicators of persistent poverty , unequal distribution of income and exclusion that still affect thousands of citizens .
Portugal still has a long way to go by European standards .
But it is also true that Europe as a whole is still a long way from the objectives of social cohesion which it seeks to achieve and which it cannot abandon .
It is a fact that the uneven levels of prosperity in the Union disclosed by economic and social indicators in recent decades have been accompanied by a considerable approximation to the European average among the less developed Member States .
The economic convergence of States must not , however , be confused with the convergence of social groups within those States , a process subject to the imperatives of equity and social justice .
From this point of view , it must be acknowledged that very little progress has been made .
In the five years from 2001 to 2005 , the poverty line in the Union countries as a whole remained static at 16 % .
We are talking about some 75 million Europeans whose disposable income is less than 60 % of the average income in their own countries .
Taking this figure in conjunction with the recorded trends in the unequal distribution of income , it becomes apparent that the situation is even less encouraging .
In 2005 , in the European Union of 25 , the income of the richest 20 % of the population was five times that of the poorest 20 % .
In 2000 , it was four and a half times as much .
A more detailed examination of these indicators shows that the social groups most at risk of poverty are the old , the unemployed - especially the long-term unemployed - people living alone and single-parent families .
Other groups , for their part , are subject to disturbing and increasing social risks because of their potential for exclusion .
I am speaking of children , people with disabilities , immigrants and ethnic minorities .
The EU Council itself recognises in its 2007 Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion that , and I quote , children have a higher-than-average risk of poverty in most Member States .
In some , almost every third child is at risk .
Living in a lone-parent or jobless household further compounds the risk .
This is a serious situation , which we cannot afford to ignore .
How can the European Union , which faces the risk of an aging population and endemic demographic recession , fail to value its most important asset , its children and young people ?
( Applause )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen ,
I wonder whether we may not have reached a point where traditional social protection policies cease to be effective .
Social security and protection policies played a decisive role in the economic revival after the Second World War and in moulding modern European societies .
What came to be known as the welfare state has left a legacy to which the Union itself owes its origins .
Building on the success of the eminently redistributive policies inspired by the idea of the welfare state , Europe has constructed an elaborate pattern of social protection which , despite the many differences between the various States , is known generally as the European social model .
With all its limitations and defects , the fact remains that this social model is now an inherent part of the European identity .
Nevertheless , if we are to defend it , we must accept that the social model will have to change in order to meet the new challenges and adapt to the new world of globalisation and the information and knowledge society .
The predominantly redistributive national policies are finding it increasingly difficult to produce any perceptible results in the social field .
The efficacy and sustainability of these policies are increasingly questionable .
It is essential , in planning future social policies , to focus on the idea of the welfare society , in which all of us , as citizens , have more responsibility and show more solidarity .
Of course , social progress depends on economic growth .
But unsustainable and unacceptable economic growth is socially destructive .
Unemployment is the main cause of poverty in most countries in the European Union .
We need more and better economic growth and that means more and better employment opportunities .
Easing participation in the labour market , according due weight and dignity to every individual contributing to the production of wealth and prosperity , in a process described as active inclusion , these represent the best protection a citizen can have against poverty and social exclusion .
The goal announced in the Lisbon Strategy to raise the employment rate in the Union to 70 % is a social imperative that must be borne in mind , though it looks as though it will be difficult to reach that goal by 2010 .
Another way of protecting citizens is to help them to acquire qualifications , help to equip them with education and training to face the new technological , environmental and cultural challenges .
It is therefore essential for Member States to give top priority to the common aim of improving levels of education and training in the younger generation and instilling the habit of life-long learning .
This will undoubtedly give them a competitive edge in future societies based on information and knowledge .
We have designated 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
That is the year when we shall be called to account and required to show how far we have maintained the ambitions that inspired us in Lisbon in 2000 .
Those ambitions include , and I quote , investing in human resources and combating social exclusion .
The aim of combating poverty and exclusion is not confined to the geographical boundaries of the European Union .
The foreign dimension of the principle of solidarity is primarily a reflection of the humanitarian values on which the European project is based .
The traditions that prevent development in the poorer countries are now combined with the problems arising from globalisation , so the campaign against poverty and under-development must become a global campaign .
That is the only way it can succeed .
The European Union has added responsibilities in this area and it has a wealth of knowledge and experience that give it a special role .
It must take the lead in the global agenda .
And it is in this context that I would draw your attention to Africa , a continent that is close to Europe and not only in geographical terms , a continent that we would do well to consider and treat as a priority partner .
The Union may find there is a heavy strategic price to pay for European inertia vis-à-vis Africa .
In this connection , I attach special importance to the forthcoming EU-Africa summit which will take place during the Portuguese Presidency .
It is time to talk with Africa and stop just talking about Africa and its problems .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen ,
I feel I cannot end this speech without touching on two subjects which I believe are absolutely decisive for the future of the Union .
First , energy and the environment .
These will undoubtedly be key sectors in the 21st century , and developments in these sectors will determine the new geopolitical shape of the world .
Energy and the environment are of vital common interest and must be regarded as new driving forces in European integration .
Here too we must build a strong ' de facto solidarity ' .
Economic efficiency , security and quality of life in the European Union depend largely on the success of energy and environmental policies .
In this connection , I must express once again my appreciation for the strategic vision and determination shown by the European Commission and its President , without which we could not have achieved the excellent results in this area that we did during the German Presidency .
Second , there is a question on all our minds .
What is the European Union 's role on the international stage and its contribution to the construction of a new world order ?
I believe it is absolutely crucial to the sustainability of the process of European integration to ensure that Europe is a central and influential player in the global , multilateral and multipolar world that is emerging .
A player with a firm , consistent and cohesive voice .
A player who is respected and who respects others .
A player who can defend the principles and values on which its economic and social model are founded .
I note , in this connection , that Portugal was among the countries which led the first wave of economic globalisation in history , and it is well aware that the future of Europe depends largely on its ability to become a credible and influential player on the international stage .
In conclusion , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I must say once again how much the extraordinary course of European integration owes to the European Parliament , an institution which has always taken the lead in defending the values and principles that forged the identity of Europe and formed the fabric of ' de facto solidarity ' our founders bequeathed to us .
I am sure that here , in this chamber , the necessary vision , will and energy will be found to pursue this admirable aim of uniting the peoples of Europe and strengthening Europe 's position in the world .
( Standing ovation )
( DE ) Mr President , that your words have been received with approval and warmth is obvious from the applause .
You spoke out for solidarity and a sense of community and those qualities underpin what we are about here in the European Union .
Only through solidarity , a sense of community and practical action will we achieve our aims .
Yours is not an empty rhetoric for you have shown in the course of your political life that you are committed to Europe and capable of taking practical action on its behalf .
Speaking for the European Parliament , I should like to assure you that we as MEPs will do all we can to support the Portuguese Presidency , so that when the Heads of State and Government meet in October we may achieve a successful outcome on the Reform Treaty .
I would also make a point of extending our gratitude and recognition to Foreign Minister Luís Amado , Secretary of State Manuel Lobo Antunes and Ambassador Álvaro Mendonça e Moura and all their colleagues , whose task it is to convey , through the process of discussions , the expression of our political will .
To them I say : ' We are with you . '
I thank you Mr President , on behalf of the European Parliament , for your impressive words to us and I wish Portugal every success in the interests of this Europe that we share .
Thank you very much indeed , Mr Cavaco Silva .
( Applause )

Presentation by the Council of the draft general budget - Budget 2008
( DE ) The next item on the agenda is the presentation by the Council of the draft general budget for 2008 .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have the honour to present , on behalf of the Presidency of the Council , the draft general budget of the European Communities for the financial year 2008 , adopted by the Council on 13 July 2007 .
I should like , first of all , to record the excellent and constructive atmosphere that prevailed during the meetings preceding the first reading of the 2008 budget by the Council .
The conciliation meeting produced a significant result , namely agreement on five joint statements on important subjects , providing a good basis for future work .
In this respect , I am convinced that the excellent cooperation between the two branches of the budgetary authority , with the valuable assistance of the Commission , augurs a positive outcome .
I can assure you that the Council is keen to continue the constructive dialogue on the budget in order to reach a satisfactory agreement on a good Community budget for 2008 .
In March 2007 we celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Treaties of Rome and reaffirmed our common values and objectives .
In the dynamic project that is the European Union , the European Union budget like the single currency is one of the most tangible expressions of what it means , for the European citizen and taxpayer , to be European .
The European Union budget must therefore be drawn up in the light of the challenges we face together .
There are various challenges but I will , if I may , draw attention to some which I consider to be more important .
First , the challenge of eliminating the barriers to entrepreneurship in order to create a dynamic European economy based on the Lisbon Strategy .
Another challenge is to create a trans-European transport network to bring us closer to one another and consolidate the internal European market .
The challenge of an information society shows the importance of human resources and social inclusion .
The European Union will derive greater strength from the enlightened participation of its citizens in this project , unique in modern history .
The latest challenge , affecting some regions in particular - the challenge of climate change - must be met by developing renewable sources of energy and by more efficient and socially responsible use of natural resources .
All these challenges arise in the context of the globalisation of the world economy , which presents a serious challenge for our old continent of Europe , a challenge we must meet at an economic and social level with policies that will increase the productivity of the European economy and strengthen social cohesion .
This is what all Europeans expect of our government .
We must all redouble our efforts to ensure that our budgets represent an effective and efficient response to the political priorities .
It is therefore necessary for us to reduce the administrative burdens , concerns shared by the Council and the European Parliament , and for the Commission to speed up the process of approving operational programmes and projects so as to avoid delays in execution .
More rapid approval must not , however , call into question the principles of good budgetary management .
It is true that we need greater flexibility but not at the cost of abandoning the efficient and responsible use of the European taxpayers ' money .
Before presenting the draft budget for 2008 in more detail , I should like to record the guiding principles behind the Council 's decision .
The essential elements , in brief , were appropriate funding for the various European Union priorities ; a carefully controlled increase in payment appropriations ; compliance with the current ceilings of the financial framework leaving , where necessary , sufficient margins below the ceilings for the various headings and sub-headings ; and lastly financial discipline and good budgetary management .
I will , if I may , mention just one detail .
In order to complete its analysis of the preliminary draft budget , the Council employed a combination of budgetary tools which proved to be extremely useful and which were developed in the context of budgeting for objectives and activities .
Among them , I should like to draw attention to the activity planning forms , where the Council considers , after examining a number of them in depth , that the overall quality of the process has improved significantly and hopes that this budgetary approach will be developed further in the future .
The draft budget for 2008 amounts to EUR 128 000 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 119 000 million in payment appropriations .
As regards commitments , I should remind you that the Council considers it essential that these reach an appropriate overall level in the 2008 budget , with due regard to the capacities for absorption .
As you know , we consider that overestimating payment appropriations is not a solution for unpaid commitments , the Reste à liquider .
One of our guiding principles was therefore to assess the needs - real and clearly defined needs - and this resulted in an increase in payments of 3.4 % compared with the 2007 budget .
As regards sub-heading 1a - Competitiveness for growth and employment - the Council intends to provide for appropriate funding of priorities connected with the Lisbon Strategy , having left a significant margin to cover the European Union priorities defined in the conclusions of the June European Council , as well as other so far unforeseen needs .
Although the Council intends to limit increases under this sub-heading in comparison with the 2007 budget , I should point out that the Council will continue to provide for a very significant increase in the Research budget , i.e. 7.75 % in commitments and 45 % in payments , in the light of the rate of execution in previous years and the capacities for absorption .
This increase reflects the great importance that the Council attaches to efficient implementation of the Lisbon Strategy which , as I have already mentioned , is an essential element in the economic development of the European Union .
As regards sub-heading 1b - Cohesion for growth and employment - the Council intends to accept the commitment appropriations proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget .
With regard to the payment appropriations , I should like to emphasise that the proposed increase has been maintained at an even more significant level , i.e. 6.2 % , taking into account the capacities for absorption and past experience with the completion of old programmes and the execution of new ones .
As regards heading 2 - Preservation and management of natural resources - the appropriations proposed by the Council were based on earlier results and past experience has shown that , despite being applied horizontally , these appropriations are generally speaking always very close to the figures for the final execution .
I should like to expand on some considerations concerning the approval of operational programmes and projects in the areas of rural development and the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013 .
This was the subject of a joint statement which we approved at our conciliation meeting and I can assure you that the Council attaches the greatest political importance to ensuring that all operational programmes and projects are executed as rapidly as possible and in an appropriate manner .
As to headings 3a and 3b - Citizenship , freedom , security and justice - the Council intends to make only one slight adjustment to the commitment and payment appropriations in accordance with the capacities for absorption and the prior rate of execution .
As regards heading 4 - The EU as a global partner - the Council intends to include some priorities with a political bearing in its draft budget .
I refer to Palestine , for which an increase of EUR 80 million is proposed , in reserve , and Kosovo , for which an increase of EUR 180 million is proposed , likewise in reserve .
We are still in the first stage of the budgetary process and I am sure we shall have further opportunities to give more precise figures in this connection .
At the present stage , the Council intends , so far as it is concerned , to accept the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget proposed in the preliminary draft budget as representing a provisional minimum .
However , it is highly probable that the amount proposed for the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget will prove to be insufficient in the light of developments in the international situation .
I think we all understand what is at stake .
I should like to end my explanatory statement with a few words about heading 5 - Administration .
The Council 's approach is based on horizontal criteria such as increased efficiency and , at the same time , on the specific nature of each institution , especially in terms of the provision of new posts in connection with enlargement .
For its own section of the budget , the Council intends to provide an increase of only 0.2 % , which seems to me to represent a clear political signal .
A detailed analysis of the budgets of the decentralised agencies was also carried out .
A method based on horizontal criteria was used both on subsidies and with regard to the number of new posts to be approved .
I also take this opportunity to say a few words about the need to ensure sound financial management of the European Union institutions .
In this connection , the Council is delighted with the joint statements which we approved at the conciliation meeting and which raise questions such as decentralised agencies , executive agencies , assigned revenues and recruitment in connection with the latest enlargements .
We all know that this is only the first step in the budgetary process , but I have every confidence that together we shall be able to explore all the possibilities in order to reach a final agreement and produce a satisfactory budget at the end of the year .
Our principal objective is to have at our disposal in due course a budget for 2008 that will be adequate for the purpose of the Union 's political priorities but that is not excessively large , because that would signify acquiescence in a probable failure to execute it effectively and efficiently .
We must bear in mind not only that this budget will affect the well-being of each and every citizen of the Union but also that it is the taxpayers of each and every Member State who foot the bill .
Hence the need to strike the right balance .
I am sure that the three institutions represented here today will make every effort to do so .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much for your kind attention .
rapporteur . - ( FI ) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , the European Parliament has now to deliberate upon the Council 's proposal for next year 's budget .
Right at the start I wish to thank the country holding the presidency , Portugal , for its excellent and transparent cooperation .
It has worked splendidly in collaboration with the European Parliament and its Committee on Budgets , in particular .
The debate has gone extremely smoothly .
Although the Council 's proposal gives cause for comment , the work of the Presidency gives us good reason to assume that we will achieve an excellent end result .
The Council 's budget proposal is a frugal one .
Compared to the preliminary draft budget , commitment appropriations have been cut by EUR 717 million , with the margin for the multiannual financial framework at EUR 3.9 billion .
Payment appropriations have come in for an even bigger cut , having been reduced by EUR 2.1 billion , meaning they are a good EUR 10.3 billion under the financial framework , which is to say just 95 % of the EU 's GNI .
When we recall how , after long and hard talks , the financial framework was adopted only a year ago , we have to regard the level of payment appropriations , and these especially , as unrealistically low .
It is regrettable that budget headings 1a ( competitiveness for growth and employment ) and 1b ( cohesion for growth and employment ) should have been made the target of particularly drastic cuts .
In the first case payment appropriations have been reduced by more than EUR 500 million and in the second by EUR 498 million .
Both of these headings concern a key priority of the European Union , the Lisbon Strategy , one now made weaker by a cut of more than a billion euros .
There are also fundamental problems for the budget in connection with heading 1 .
Last year the European Parliament warned the Council that financing for the European Galileo navigation system was too inadequate .
Now there is a shortfall of EUR 2.4 billion , because the private sector did not get involved .
Under its resolution , the European Parliament is supporting a project using Community funds coming out of the Union 's budget .
This is the simplest procedure , the least bureaucratic and the most democratic .
Such a huge sum of money , EUR 400 million a year , is nevertheless impossible to find , given the current financial framework , and so we need a joint decision by Parliament and the Council .
We can rescue this important European project , but it will have to be done in the context of this budget procedure .
Another problem is the European Institute of Technology , the EIT .
If we do want to set it up it will have to be financed sustainably .
It cannot be based on hopes and assumptions , but needs realistic decisions .
The idea that the EIT would almost certainly receive cash out of EU programmes based on free competition is just a dream .
What if it were to come true , though ?
That is why we need realistic solutions .
There is a special problem concerning next year 's budget , and that relates to the Structural Funds , the Cohesion Fund and rural development funds .
Only a few of the Structural Funds ' Operational Programmes have been approved .
Just 20 % of the 335 Programmes under the European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Fund have been approved , but the figure for the European Social Fund is just less than 10 % .
Most worrying is the situation concerning the Rural Development Fund , where just two of the 96 Programmes have been approved .
In June the European Parliament and the Council adopted a declaration which focuses attention on this , and they promised to monitor the Commission 's actions here .
Parliament for its own part promises to enforce this declaration .
Finally , I want to emphasise the importance of good management .
The European Parliament wants to promote activity-based management and budgeting .
We , together with the Council , passed a declaration which stresses the importance of a cost-benefit analysis and accountability when new agencies are being set up .
We need to insist on this .
The theme of next year 's budget is the Budget for Results .
The purpose is to emphasise the notion that it is the appropriations that need to be used to achieve the desired results .
Management is not the main issue here : it is results .
I firmly believe that we , along with the Council and the Commission , will succeed in establishing such a budget for next year .
Thank you very much , Mr Virrankoski , and thank you too for observing the speaking time so scrupulously .
It would seem that the Finns have everything well under control here .
Representatives from smaller countries such as Finland , just like those from larger states , are capable of exerting great influence .
Our other rapporteur is also a Finn : you have the floor , Mr Itälä .
rapporteur . - ( FI ) Mr President , the most important principles to be observed when Parliament and other institutions were drafting next year 's budget were thrift and budgetary discipline .
We have to set an example to the taxpayer , the ordinary European citizen , and show that we can also take responsibility for economic matters .
This is the only way we can win the trust of the people .
Parliament 's new Secretary-General has put forward a new proposal for Parliament 's 2008 budget , and I would like to congratulate him , since it is extremely good and well-balanced .
It will help us find a compromise when taking the final decision .
I should mention two things concerning the proposal .
Firstly , the Secretary-General 's proposal is still below 20 % of heading 5 , i.e. the increase does not use up the whole 20 % .
The other important matter is that he has been able to place a lot of existing employees in new posts , whereas all the posts should have been made vacant .
We nevertheless have to remember what this process in Parliament is like generally .
We have already adopted certain principles here a few times this year .
One is that Parliament 's budget is a taxpayer 's budget , and that we would try to keep to the 2007 expenditure levels where new projects are concerned .
We are not so very far off this target , and I believe that all the projects proposed can be carried out when we determine the precise sums in accordance with budgetary discipline .
I wish to raise another matter concerning Parliament 's budget , and that has to do with information policy .
Various projects have been set up with a view to the forthcoming elections , such as the Web TV , and the most important thing of all is for MEPs and the political groups to be closely involved in all aspects of Parliament 's information policy .
So the groups and Members must keep themselves in the picture and not leave the administration in charge of information policy : people want to know why an individual member or group votes a certain way or puts forward given proposals .
People want to know the political background , and we should therefore be involved .
I hope that the idea about inviting the small , local media along , as now agreed , goes through to the final version .
One way to get close to the people is for us to invite along the small , local media , which do not have the funds themselves to come here to Parliament .
This obviously has to happen through our Members .
I would like to come back again to the other institutions .
The Council has proposed a 2 % cut across the board for all institutions .
As rapporteur , I have to say this is difficult to accept , as the institutions differ greatly from one another .
Some are small , some large , and they vary in the sort of work they do .
Let me take as an example the Court of Auditors , which I visited yesterday .
They have been very economical and have complied with budgetary discipline for many years now .
They have posted a surplus for everything , they have not wasted money , and their expenditure consists of salaries and fixed costs , and nothing else .
This 2 % cut would be completely out of the question for the Court of Auditors .
The whole scheme would fall apart if we were to go with it .
I hope we will reach agreement on the idea of going over possible areas where savings can be made for each individual institution .
In principle I agree with the Council that everyone needs to exercise thrift and areas where savings can be made have to be found , but I am not in favour of a universal 2 % policy .
Chairman of the Committee on Budgets . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentleman , what we are discussing today is the second year 's implementation of the agreed Financial Perspective ; we are discussing implementation of multiannual programmes with European added value as determined in codecision ; and we are discussing additional commitments to reform by all three institutions .
I should like to assure the Council Presidency that a promising start was made , in terms of basic agreements , with the tripartite dialogue and the conciliation procedure on 13 July .
The five statements to which you referred , particularly concerning how we deal with the decentralised agencies , are a move in the right direction and one on which I hope we can build .
I should also like to tell you , Commissioner , that your initiative for a two-stage presentation on implementation of the budget is another important step in the interests of efficient budgetary policy on the part of both the Commission and the European Parliament .
Obviously , what we have to do now , in this budgetary procedure on the basis of the Council 's draft , is to ensure budget discipline and to safeguard commitments already entered into , but of course we also have to adjust the foreseeable and anticipated figures .
In that regard , I do not understand what the Council has said in its additional statement in relation to the sub-headings on growth and employment ( 1a ) and on agricultural policy and market-related expenditure - namely that if the amounts are insufficient , the Commission must be asked to submit an amending budget .
Heading 4 , foreign policy , has to be highlighted yet again as chronically under-financed .
I must point out , too , that in the negotiations on the Financial Perspective we flagged up these shortfalls right from the outset .
So we shall work to ensure that agreed programmes are properly implemented in terms of both commitments and payments .
At the same time - and let me make this quite clear - we shall not accept any shelving of our political priorities either in the current budgetary procedure , Commissioner , or indeed through major global transfers at the end of a budget year .
I want to say explicitly that the statement on implementation of the Structural Funds and rural development was important for us , and we would ask the Commission to submit a progress report as soon as possible because the Member States and the regions quite rightly expect to see the programmes in question here implemented without delay .
Taken overall , the statements concerning the decentralised agencies , advocating improved cost-benefit analysis , make for greater transparency and greater clarity about the staff actually employed there - whether permanently or temporarily - and they constitute a qualitative step forward which , in conjunction with the Commission 's so-called ' screening report ' on establishment plans , amounts to positive progress and must be further developed , studied and more thoroughly pursued .
The watchword in this regard , I would add , should be prudence as opposed to over-reaction .
Of course , much of what we currently complain about in relation to decentralisation or the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation results from Community decisions , for which we all bear our share of responsibility .
The solution is a familiar one and it entails slimming down procedures and simplifying them to some extent .
In that regard , there remains a great deal of work to be done .
Allow me to say something here on two or three key points .
The figure for payments in the Commission 's preliminary draft was EUR 8.2 billion less than the ceiling in the Financial Perspective .
Now the Council has submitted a draft with a figure EUR 10.3 billion below the ceiling .
If you look at the Council 's summary table , however , you will find that the content is highly questionable .
Under the heading for the Lisbon Strategy , growth and employment , for example , the fact of creating a new EUR 342 million margin , and reducing the payments by EUR 548 million from the figure in the preliminary draft , effectively amounts to making an artificial margin to accommodate the European Council 's pronouncements on political priorities .
I assume that the underlying issues are the problem of financing the European Institute of Technology and the problem of financing the Galileo project .
Let me be very clear here : Parliament firmly favours a Community solution for the Galileo project and , in the overall context , awaits new proposals from the Commission .
I have one brief comment on Heading 3 : in relation to natural disasters , what has happened to former Commissioner Michel Barnier 's proposals on civil defence in Europe ?
Do we have a joint response and , if so , how might it impact on the 2008 and subsequent budgets ?
Mr President , the foreign and security policy issues , to which we have referred repeatedly , confirm that our political analyses were correct : the current figures in the draft budget are insufficient to address the challenges in Afghanistan , Palestine or Kosovo , and cutting the Emergency Aid Reserve is merely a virtual solution , the point of which we cannot grasp .
In this regard , we would ask the Commission to state clearly what , from its perspective , lies in store for us in the coming years .
I have one final point , Mr President .
The Member States undertook - and I quote here - referring to the Statement of Assurance mentioned in paragraph 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement : ' to produce an annual summary at the appropriate level of the available audits and declarations ' .
' to produce an annual summary at the appropriate level of the available audits and declarations ' .
I say this very much in earnest : those Member States not in a position to guarantee that the annual report will arrive in good time may expect us to take issue with them on this matter on budgetary as well as other grounds .
Otherwise , I fully support what our two rapporteurs have said .
I would like to welcome everyone to the new season , which seems interesting and intensive as always . It is so gratifying that already in July we achieved some very productive and well-intentioned communication .
In Lithuania it is said that a good start is half the job .
Therefore , I hope that the atmosphere in which we have started working and the results that we have already managed to achieve by negotiating and adopting three important declarations is a really good start to the task at hand .
Today we discussed the first version of the Council 's budget , although I very often hear from Parliament that we - the Commission - are given so many tasks .
I certainly accept this and agree with it ; we are ready to react and provide any information that is required .
As regards the first draft of the Council budget , I would like to mention that the Commission , when it presented its version , referred to the forecasts of the Member States using our analysis .
We therefore believe that our proposal was fully economically and politically sound .
Therefore , the Commission cannot fully agree with many aspects of the Council 's first negotiated budget .
Certainly , we agree with the opinion already presented by MEPs that the biggest horizontal cuts ...
I would like to repeat that the method of horizontal cutting was applied again in all categories .
The Commission , certainly , considers that this approach and methodology is unsound , particularly in categories 1a and 1b , where we talk about innovation and research , even more so as we have an additional problem with the European Institute of Technology and the Galileo programme , which has to be solved as an additional parallel problem of the annual European budget procedures .
Certainly , this means that it is necessary to return to discussions on quantities and sizes and not to consider arithmetical reductions .
The same applies to agriculture and the category of foreign affairs policy where , in my opinion , the Council 's approach of putting funds in reserve is rather conservative and , surely , we will all have to return to it soon .
Over the coming fortnight the Commission will be presenting its proposal to Parliament and the Council on the adjustment of the budget as regards Kosovo and Palestine .
Certainly , as always , we worry about the Council 's approach to administrative expenditure and I agree that the budget has a certain Finnish colouring , especially in the European Parliament .
I mean this in a good sense , because I see the need for discipline , strict responsibility and soundness in the expenditure of the country representatives and we accept this and will always respond to it .
The Council 's proposal includes the horizontal cut in the conditions in which the Council itself will not be able to fulfil its commitment to employ extra people ; more than 800 staff members to perform additional developmental tasks surely cannot be acceptable to the Commission .
We really expect Parliament to have the same attitude towards this issue as we do and hope that the re-adjustment will be made jointly with Parliament .
Briefly speaking , therefore , it is gratifying that the beginning has been successful .
Yet we react critically to the Council 's first proposal and assess it critically , and we are ready to discuss Kosovo and Palestine in the short term and also to discuss and take decisions on the proposals on the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology on around the 19th and will try to come to a mutual understanding on these important issues .
I therefore hope for a successful procedure and hope that my fellow Lithuanians manage to translate my first Lithuanian speech well and correctly .
( DE ) The debate is closed .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( RO ) The Lisbon Strategy requires that 3 % of the Member States ' GDP should be invested in research , two thirds originating from the private sector .
Only a very small number of European regions reached this goal .
In 2004 , 42 % of European companies carried out research on their activities and Member States invested only 1.84 % of their GDP on research .
In 2006 , 35 % of the EU active population worked in the field of science and technology .
Education is essential for the future of the EU .
It should be accessible to everybody , either rich or poor , living in either the urban or rural environment .
The quality of European education should be measured depending on the graduation rate and the admission rate to the next education level .
We need a new Social Europe , in which its citizens should have priority .
Having regard to the fact that both the European Union and its Member States will approve their budgets for 2008 in the autumn , I require that the investments in education and research have priority in the European Union .
Inland transport of dangerous goods ( debate )
The next item is the report by Bogusław Liberadzki , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the inland transport of dangerous goods - C6-0012 / 2007 - .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to submit to you today the proposal for amendment of the directive on the inland transport of dangerous goods .
The transport of dangerous goods accounts for about 8 % of all goods transport , nearly a million operations every day .
We have to guarantee freedom of movement for dangerous goods and intermodality in national and international services , whilst at the same time keeping an eye on the safety aspect in order to protect our environment , our citizens and workers in the sector .
This proposal is designed to update four directives and four Commission decisions on the transport of dangerous goods by merging them in a single legislative act .
This is an important simplification of Community law on the subject .
In addition , the scope of the Community rules needs to be extended to include inland waterways transport , a sector that is not covered by any rules of Community law at present .
Admittedly it is a less significant mode of inland transport , but an accident on an inland waterway can have serious consequences .
A single set of rules for all transport of dangerous goods in internal waterways will make it possible to minimise those risks .
Finally , the proposal relates to both international and national transport .
Those are the aims of the proposal for which Mr Liberadzki is rapporteur .
Before the debate begins , may I thank your rapporteur and TRAN for their support for the Commission proposal .
rapporteur . - ( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , it is my pleasure , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , to submit a report in which , first of all , we welcome the fact that the Commission has submitted the draft directive that we are considering today .
We are in complete agreement with you , Commissioner , that this consolidates , and at the same time reduces the number of , the regulations relating to the transport of dangerous goods .
Secondly , we also agree that this regulation could have a very big impact both on transport safety and also on the quality of life of the public .
Finally , the regulations that we wish to adopt , or rather to combine from many different sources , thereby reducing the number , are based on the recommendations drawn up by the UN for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland waterways , which together account for over 110 billion tonnes / km per annum within the European Union .
In presenting this report I would like to emphasise that the Committee on Transport and Tourism approved it almost unanimously , deeming it to be both important and necessary , and that it brings in a new level of quality in that it extends regulations concerning the transport of dangerous goods to passenger trains .
It also regulates when Member States , for reasons that are not strictly to do with safety , can introduce certain derogations from generally applicable regulations , and how these derogations should be introduced and dealt with at EU level .
I would like to ask everyone here to support the amendments that have been discussed and introduced , especially Amendment 44 , where , at the request of the Council , in addition to vehicles we introduce the concepts of wagons and inland waterway vessels , in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding , and I would ask you to vote in favour of this .
I would also specifically like to ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 45 , which , after much discussion , was drawn up as a good compromise .
This refers to Article 1 ( 3 ) ( b ) , where we have introduced the words ' where justified , it is possible to prescribe the route and the means of transport to be used ' .
Then Amendment 16 could be omitted as unnecessary , or we could vote against it .
I would also ask you to vote against Amendments 46 and 47 , since it would appear that these rules are already included in the text , and so they will merely pad out the regulation unnecessarily .
Finally , I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation , which was very productive .
I would particularly like to thank the Council and the Commission - the Council both under the German Presidency and under the Portuguese Presidency .
We had about five working meetings .
There were no significant differences of views , and we were able to resolve any differences that did arise .
In my opinion this was a model of cooperation .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , yes , the proposal for a directive on the internal transport of dangerous goods is an important issue , because around 110 billion tonnes / km of dangerous goods are transported in the EU every year : 58 % by road , 25 % by rail and , up to now , 17 % by inland waterway .
The purpose of this proposal for a directive is to simplify and coordinate the existing rules on the transport of dangerous goods .
It also extends the scope of the EU provisions , which currently cover transport by road and rail , to transport by inland waterway .
That simplification reduces the red tape and improves intermodality .
Common rules on transport by road , rail and inland waterway ensure a uniform level of safety throughout the Community in internal and cross-border transport .
Uniform rules governing means of transport simplify and promote multimodal transport .
Extending the scope of the provisions to inland waterway transport is a welcome move .
That means the same safety rules apply to all Community inland waterways .
That will have a positive impact on working conditions on board , on transport safety and on protection of the environment .
Uniform rules reduce costs by avoiding the need for a variety of authorisations and permissions .
Moreover , that is likely to improve the potential use and the market prospects of transport by inland waterways ; after all , we are trying to shift more transport of dangerous goods to inland waterways .
The draft amendments adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism largely reflect the Council 's position .
We are in agreement and we want to try to get this through at first reading if possible .
Let me underline that I do beg the House to adopt one particular draft amendment , which the rapporteur has already mentioned and which represents a compromise .
It is important to include sensible provisions in this dossier .
Here we are in agreement with the Commission and the Council .
The draft amendment relates to the provision allowing Member States to lay down specific safety requirements and possibly also to prescribe the means of transport if they can justify it before the Commission .
In conclusion , let me give warm thanks to the rapporteur , with whom we were able to work so well together , and request the House to adopt this report at first reading .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , on behalf of my group I would like to thank the rapporteur , not only for his report but also for his inclusiveness in bringing together Parliament , the Council and the various political factions on this important issue .
Members will be aware that current Community law in this area resides primarily in four directives that deal with the transportation of dangerous goods .
The RID Directive and the ADR Directive deal with rail and road respectively , with the transport of dangerous goods by inland waterways covered by the annexes to these two directives .
The proposed new directive now extends the scope of Community law to inland waterways and we need to support such a move .
Some people may think that the rapporteur has not gone far enough in challenging the scope of the directive and there are others , mainly from industry , who think the directive too proscriptive and that it goes too far .
The rapporteur has , frankly , got the balance right and surely the important aspect of all of this is that we would establish a single system of regulation for the transport of dangerous goods by inland waterways , with standards laid down and with everybody , including Member States , knowing their responsibilities .
This report does give us added value , as explained by our rapporteur .
It will enhance safety and therefore , I believe , and my group believes , deserves our full support .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) As has already been said , Mr President , the proposal seeks to update and consolidate the existing directives and regulations on the inland transport of dangerous goods .
A single legal text will now cover inland waterway transport in addition to road and rail transport .
In all honesty I wonder how anyone could possibly oppose it .
I cannot imagine that anyone questions the usefulness of and need for measures to ensure that these transport operations are conducted in the safest way possible .
If these measures can be combined and worded more clearly , then that benefits all of us .
In committee we upheld most of the rapporteur 's chiefly technical amendments .
Clearly the rapporteur liaised closely on these with the Council and , on a directive of this kind , that is generally the most efficient way of going about it .
So it is commendable too that the rapporteur is keen to secure an agreement at first reading .
But the ALDE Group was rather surprised by Amendment 45 and finds it a bit casual .
Why not settle for the text used in Amendment 16 , which everyone was happy with , ourselves included ?
Why go along with everything the Council wants , even when that may work against the efficiency of logistics chains ?
Why not talk to the Council about this ?
Not all Member States are in favour of this ' compromise ' .
What will the rapporteur , and also Mrs Sommer and Messrs Jarzembowski and Simpson , have achieved if Member States are able arbitrarily to favour one mode of transport over another ?
Surely it is obvious that every mode of transport must ensure , in its own specific way , that its operations are safe and efficient .
Why should the market players not be able to determine that for themselves ?
We made sure of that previously with Amendment 16 and so I urge you to take another look at Amendment 45 and maybe think again .
My thanks to the rapporteur for his hard work , but I think it is a pity he allowed himself to be seduced into reintroducing this provision on the use of prescribed forms of transport by the back door .
Again , I urge you to reconsider your position on Amendment 45 .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the proposed new directive on the regulation of the inland transport of dangerous goods is a necessary piece of legislation .
It integrates previous EU regulations into a single piece of legislation and extends it to include transport by water .
The inclusion in the proposal of international regulations on the transport of dangerous goods makes the directive a consolidated document of international scope .
The new directive also makes it possible , to a limited extent , to take specific national conditions into consideration , where this is dictated by economic requirements and the state of the roads .
An example here could be the extent to which megaliners are used .
The amendments that have been proposed are technical in nature and do not give cause for concern , except for Amendments 46 and 47 .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Liberadzki , for his constructive input in the preparation of the report .
The UEN takes the view that the directive meets the expectations of those concerned .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , these are very positive rules for multimodal transport , which I hope will grow in future , because they are more transparent and easier to understand .
At last , inland waterways have been included , as the Greens had requested in an earlier report .
I found it hard to understand why this took so long .
The pollution caused by an accident involving a vessel transporting highly toxic chemicals can , of course , cause even more concentrated pollution if it happens on a river than might be case on the high seas .
I regard the stringent rules that Member States may lay down , and that extend to prescribing the means of transport , as necessary , important and right .
Conditions on our various transport routes are extremely varied .
There may be high bridges , for instance , that are inaccessible to rescue forces .
There may be high traffic density , which can under certain circumstances make the transport of dangerous goods even more hazardous .
Dangerous goods are often transported in the vicinity of towns .
All this means that we must provide Member States with that possibility , so that they can react to such dangers in a flexible manner .
A central issue in this report , however , as in many others , is monitoring .
The national states must systematically monitor compliance with the rules , otherwise we will have empty words that pretend to a kind of safety that , unfortunately , does not exist .
To be quite frank , there are serious deficiencies in this area in some European states .
There is also a major challenge to be met in terms of training fire-fighters and rescue forces .
I hope this also acts as an incentive to make this monitoring more stringent and at last to minimise the dangers of transport - whether by water , rail or road .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , the use of just in time delivery by industry and trade , with the ultimate aim , in short , of maximum immediate profit , means that dangerous goods are less and less in warehouses and secure factories and more and more on roads , rivers and railways and at sea .
For very many years , the European Commission has been doing everything it can to deregulate the transport sector for the greater benefit of private interests , taking no account of the general interest .
So much so that , when anyone raises the issue of public safety , the Commission immediately takes refuge in the subsidiarity principle .
As always , the European Commission boasts of having worked closely with employers , forgetting , as always , the workers who might have been able to teach it a great deal , especially about the general deregulation of the transport sector , social dumping , and the refusal to introduce binding legislation on working conditions and training for road transport staff .
There is a serious risk of a major disaster involving a dangerous goods consignment in the future .
Then those who have made the decisions will be responsible .
Yet this Parliament could vote for simple and effective measures , such as the designation of lorry parks as Seveso sites and triage at railway transit points for dangerous goods ; imposing a traceability obligation in real time with a system of geographical location of all dangerous goods to ensure that incompatible products are not kept together ; and training in the necessary safety measures for the personnel involved .
But most people see this as unnecessary expenditure .
Well , you can assume that , but do not count on us for support !
on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Liberadzki 's excellent report and his well-argued proposal for a directive on the inland transport of dangerous goods requires little discussion .
I voted for it in committee , and I confirm my vote here and believe that many colleagues from the ITS Group will follow my example .
The more internal trade such as that between the Union 's Member States increases , the more useful it is , in my opinion , for the conditions in which that trade takes place to be comparable , especially in terms of safety , but also from the point of view of checks and related administrative procedures .
It would be unreasonable to criticise or even worse reject such a technical text on which there has been wide-ranging and informed consultation with many experts from the Member States .
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank , in addition to Mr Liberadzki , the dangerous goods committee for their work , bearing in mind that that work has been carried out continuously in accordance with the international agreements in force in this field .
I would like to conclude by noting that the amendments , or at least many of the amendments tabled , should in my opinion be accepted , especially Amendment 2 to Recital 14 , the amendments relating to observations on the obvious non-inclusion and therefore exemption of those Member States which do not as yet have a railway system , and frankly I also intend to support Amendment 45 .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Vice-President , ladies and gentlemen , first I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my good friend the rapporteur , Bogusław Liberadzki , on this really balanced and successful report .
As Mrs Sommer has already pointed out , 110 billion tonnes / km of dangerous goods are transported in the EU every year .
Like Mr Henin , I too would prefer at least part of that quantity to be stored in warehouses .
Unfortunately that is not the case , which is why we must look into that matter too .
A first , important point in this report is the updating and coordination of existing rules on safety requirements for tanks and vehicles .
A second important point is the extension of that requirement from road and rail to inland waterways .
If we look at the transport trend in recent years , it becomes very clear that inland waterways are becoming increasingly important .
I agree with Mrs Lichtenberger that accidents on rivers are , of course , particularly dangerous .
These measures - and here I am speaking as someone who lives in a country of transit - may also lead to a shift towards the railways .
That is , of course , a very good thing .
We in Austria naturally welcome this report , in particular because Austria , given its geographical location , sets very high safety requirements for transport participants .
I also find it extremely welcome that in future every Member State is also to have the right to regulate or prohibit the internal transport of dangerous goods on its territory .
In my view , that includes in particular laying down special provisions on environmental protection and the option of prohibiting or restricting the transport of certain hazardous goods .
If the report is adopted in the wording proposed by the rapporteur , it will be a very good report and we can all be satisfied with the outcome .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should also like to thank our rapporteur for the work he has headed on the really very technical issues involved in the transport of dangerous goods , which represent nearly 10 % of the goods across Europe .
I certainly welcome the fact that not only does the report shed light on rules that affect public safety , it is also extended to inland waterways goods transport , because many of us think that is a mode of transport that should be developed throughout Europe as an alternative to road transport .
It also raises high hopes on the part of European citizens .
As well as being a step towards simplification of the legislation as regards the administrative procedures , for both consignors and consignees , it is also a crucial step for the training of personnel involved with the safety of dangerous goods .
Although we have to define our position on certain points raised in the amendments in more detail , the report undoubtedly represents a step forward , on clarity in particular and on safety .
Mr President , I wholeheartedly echo the comments of my Group colleague , Mrs Lichtenberger .
We welcome this package as a step in the right direction , albeit with some reservations .
Our amendments seek to strengthen the package , particularly in relation to training in how to deal with accidents and the right of individuals to know what is being transported .
I personally would like to go further still .
I would like to include military and civil nuclear materials in the same framework .
Scotland , sadly , plays host to military nuclear facilities and civil nuclear sites and sees regular transports .
The Sunday Herald newspaper recently revealed that 67 nuclear safety incidents relating to transport have taken place in Scotland over the last seven years .
So there is clear room for improvement , and I believe that the EU can act where the UK Government will fail to .
In the meantime , however , I welcome any steps in the direction of giving people greater rights to know what they are sharing the roads and waterways of Europe with , and that they are safe .
This report helps to do that , so we welcome it .
( RO ) Mr President , Commissioner , dear MEPs , between 1995-2004 freight transport increased by 28 % , and by 2020 a 50 % increase is predicted .
58 % of the freight transported is carried by road , 25 % by rail and 17 % by internal navigable waterways .
Dangerous goods represent 8 % of the transported freight .
This transport type highly endangers the regions the goods are carried through and therefore , the European Union must take the necessary measures to increase the security of this transport type .
The existing laws in the European Union cover only the transport of dangerous goods by road and by rail , but for transport by sea there are only international conventions to which Member States are party .
Following Romania and Bulgaria 's accession to the EU , almost the entire length of the Danube has become an internal navigable waterway .
The Danube runs through seven European capitals and nearby many urban agglomerations , that is why the safety of the transport of dangerous goods along Danube is extremely important .
It is essential that the measures on the transport of dangerous goods should be doubled with measures on the intervention of emergency services in cases of accidents where such transports are involved .
There is a huge number of victims , even among those who should intervene in the event of an accident .
Moreover , the transport of dangerous goods should be carried out during less crowded periods and routes , so that the related risks can be minimized .
I think that for the safety of the transport of dangerous goods a short a transition period as possible is needed in order to implement this Directive .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to thank Mr Liberadzki and the Committee on Transport and Tourism again for this excellent report , which , like you , I really hope will enable us to adopt the proposal right away at first reading .
In fact , it is because we are anxious for it to be adopted at first reading that we are ready to agree to the amendments reflecting the negotiated agreement between the institutions .
We do not , however , think the amendments that would jeopardise agreement at first reading are desirable .
What is true is that , as everyone has emphasised , the report will help to simplify the legislation and therefore make it easier to apply and thus to extend to inland waterways .
I agree with Parliament that the inland waterways networks should be widely developed .
They can be a way for Europe to achieve the modal shift that we would like to see .
That is what I wanted to make clear .
Once again , I thank Parliament and its rapporteur for its excellent work on this report , backed by expert knowledge .
I think it can be said that the consultation on this report was absolutely exemplary .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing - ( FR ) The steady rise in the transport of dangerous goods has made it necessary to introduce European legislation to simplify and coordinate the rules applicable to the transport of these goods .
It is our responsibility to protect public safety and that also applies to the transport of dangerous goods .
It therefore seems important to me that Member States should be able , if necessary and in a proportionate and transparent fashion , to require the use of mandatory routes .
They must also be able to insist that carriers use one mode of transport rather than another if they believe that that will be safer for their citizens .
Freight transport logistics in Europe and sustainable mobility ( debate )
The next item is the report by Inés Ayala Sender , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , on freight transport logistics in Europe - the key to sustainable mobility .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Mr President , this afternoon we are discussing a key sector for European growth , competition and employment , namely logistics .
Logistics are essential to the quality of our citizens ' daily lives , although they do not perceive this clearly enough .
This exercise attempts among other things to increase the visibility of this topic among citizens .
This is a sector which accounts for approximately 13 % of GDP in the European Union and has great economic impact as it amounts to between 10 and 15 % of the final cost of finished products in Europe .
In some sectors , such as the important automotive industry , it exceeds even social costs .
It is also a sector which hitherto has appeared to be a matter exclusively for industry and the market ; its success and potential for growth appeared incontrovertible and this must continue to be the case .
The talk is currently of growth of some 50 % between the years 2000 and 2020 .
Therefore the sector will be able to exploit and increase the opportunities open to it in a situation which we perceive as being defined around five essential priorities .
The first priority is the recent enlargement towards the east which increases distances and creates outlying areas ; at the same time , however , it also creates new opportunities both in terms of markets and trade in our citizens ' diverse cultures .
The second priority is globalisation , which accelerates trade , diversifies needs and redefines the geographical position of territories and peoples .
I am thinking here of my own country , Spain , which appears to be peripheral where enlargement is concerned , yet is placed by globalisation on a crossroads between areas as important as Latin America , Africa or trade with Asia .
Another of the priorities for tackling logistics is climate change and current energy needs .
We need to make infrastructure use more efficient , improve traffic management and restrict unladen journeys ; current logistics can make a major contribution to this .
The fourth priority is the opportunities for Information Exchange that we are seeking in Europe under the Seventh Framework Programme and the whole future of the knowledge economy .
Logistics are the very embodiment of intelligent transport - transport which includes planning as a fundamental concept and is based increasingly on intelligent transport systems .
SESAR , SafeSeaNet and Track and Trade are all devices and new technologies which are being successfully applied to this sector .
Finally , demographic changes and young people 's employment expectations are also areas to which logistics can make a decisive contribution .
To that end the proposal for a report specifically tries to support the Commission in identifying bottlenecks and trying to draw up new proposals .
We need to prevent the administrative burden being too great by using precisely these intelligent systems to reduce and restrict formalities , which remain complex , especially in , for example , customs and maritime trade ; I believe , however , that the proposals the Commission is making in this regard in its action plan are potentially very positive .
Another bottleneck for which we are also proposing a number of solutions is the lack of infrastructure and shortfalls in associated funding .
To that end we reiterate the need to terminate the system of cross-border networks by opening up unused historic passes in the Pyrenees , or in the Alps where we believe it would also help , and reducing congestion on some roads by opening rail tunnels .
There is also a specific proposal to that end which I particularly support , namely the proposal for a system of dedicated freight railways .
We would urge the Commission to submit a plan to us on the subject .
As for the need for finance , what we would like is for the debate on the future funding of a sufficiently ambitious European transport policy to include logistics as a priority concern .
Regarding the lack of manpower we support the Commission in its proposal to make the profession more attractive but we would like it to refer not only to training but to improving social and working conditions .
Finally , we also wish to support and encourage the Commission in this regard when we point to the need for any future consideration of urban transport to include a specific chapter on urban logistics .
We believe that our citizens endure congestion on a daily basis when logistics , which if successful are invisible , are shown to have failed .
To that end we believe it is time that logistics took its rightful place in European discussions .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I particularly want to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her report on freight transport logistics .
I should also say to Mrs Ayala Sender that I remember our visit to Zaragoza , where we had the opportunity to see the benefits of all the work currently being done in Europe on developing logistics .
The report gives us high hopes of the approach adopted by the Commission in its communication on logistics in 2006 .
This resolution is an important step in the joint efforts by Parliament and the Commission to improve the operation of freight transport in Europe .
I find it very encouraging , because in a few weeks ' time I shall be presenting the Action Plan for Logistics .
Mrs Ayala Sender has eloquently set out the issues at stake : the economic dimension and the efficiency of logistics , which are a key element in the competitiveness of our economies .
Logistics facilitate the flow of goods and help make our products competitive by giving them access to more distant markets .
Thus logistics have become an important and dynamic industry that creates jobs and Europe has the most successful logistics companies in this field .
Furthermore , logistics improve environmental efficiency .
As Mrs Ayala Sender has said , they help to minimise transport congestion .
Freight transport and logistics also have to meet the challenges of reducing the number of road accidents and pollutant and noise emissions .
The work to be done on logistics does not involve regulating this rapidly growing sector , but ensuring that it has a sustainable future by allowing it to mobilise the efficiency potential that still exists in the transport business .
In fact , that is why we have developed the idea of comodality , the effective combination of different modes of transport .
In that respect we can use logistics to reconcile the economic and environmental objectives .
However , there are still some obstacles to the development of logistics .
First , the lack of harmonisation and common rules stands in the way of new solutions , particularly the development of information and communication technology .
We could plan freight transport better , we could improve the operation and safety of transport systems , we should improve the monitoring of goods and ensure that customers have the necessary information .
The logistics chain must work as a coherent whole , even if several partners and several modes of transport are involved .
Secondly , we must lay more emphasis on quality in freight transport , with service quality indicators and the sharing of good practice .
That means improving the training of practitioners and recognising their skills .
Thirdly , we have to address the problem of bottlenecks , obstacles to freight transport .
We have consulted everyone working in the logistics field and received five hundred replies , which will help us in our preparation for the Action Plan for Logistics .
The report by Mrs Ayala Sender also , rightly , highlights the simplification of administrative procedures , infrastructure investment needs and the problems posed by logistics in urban areas .
We need concrete answers to all those questions .
I am pleased that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has attached real importance to the Action Plan for Logistics that I shall be presenting in October .
The plan should propose concrete measures with clear objectives and a specific timetable .
It will be one of a set of initiatives including a freight priority rail network , a port policy and two Commission documents on the maritime space without borders and motorways of the sea .
The adoption of those measures will be an important signal and a way for us to identify alternative modes of transport that are efficient , integrated and environmentally friendly and , of course , meet the needs of users .
The Action Plan will be coupled with measures to make rail , sea and inland waterways transport more attractive .
The Commission does not claim to be able to solve the freight transport problems facing Europe on its own , but , on that point too , the report by Mrs Ayala Sender sends a message to the Member States to encourage them to develop their own logistics initiatives , especially by investing in infrastructures , in close collaboration with the European Union .
We shall only succeed if the Member States and the European Union act together .
Logistics are a major problem .
By working on them , we shall achieve the modal shift that we want to see in the fight against global warming .
In my view , the way to make European mobility sustainable , that is to say compatible with our environmental requirements for the benefit of the economy and of European citizens , is through good logistics and good transport infrastructures .
May I thank Mrs Ayala Sender wholeheartedly for her contribution to these advances in logistics , which are key to the development of sustainable transport .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Ayala Sender , most sincerely for a very creditable report .
I am nevertheless sorry that the Committee on Transport and Tourism omitted from the report certain key issues which the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy brought up .
Of these , the most important is the internalisation of the external costs of transport , such as environmental costs .
Pricing that takes account of real costs , including environmental and social costs , is a fundamental means of making a transport system intelligent , efficient and rational .
In Switzerland the road toll on lorry transport has led to the effective transfer of consignments to the railways and reduced the number of trucks travelling empty .
This is a good example to us all .
It needs to be realised that an efficient , rational transport system is not the same as the constant expansion of road traffic .
Carbon dioxide emissions from traffic cannot continue to increase as they are doing now ; otherwise the reductions in emissions achieved in other sectors , such as industry , will have been a waste of time .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first I want to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for their work .
Freight transport logistics is such a broad subject that it is not always easy to confine oneself to essentials .
As it is put so well in French : ' qui trop embrasse mal étreint ' .
So let us be glad that today we have managed to pick out the key points !
We have to tread new ground , because this is not an easy field .
It is an area of conflict between the economy and growth on the one side , and the environment and security on the other .
Put simply : everybody wants the goods , nobody wants the transport .
That means that this sector , which does indeed offer very good employment prospects , does not have a very good image .
We must do our part to remind people firstly that it is an important economic sector , secondly that we can tread new ground , and thirdly that the sector still has employment potential today .
I still regard the reference to training as very important and it should be taken up by the various countries .
Specialisation in these areas can lead to new and interesting jobs .
Research can also help make freight transport more efficient , environmentally compatible and also more secure .
Cooperation among countries remains essential .
We need only think of the Trans-European Networks .
We all think globally , nobody wants to act locally .
To put it simply , we want these networks everywhere , but we do not have the resources , whether we negotiate with the Council to get more funds for the Trans-European Networks or with the countries themselves .
As regards modes of transport , I believe nobody has anything against shifting goods to the railways and inland waterways , but efficiency is the key point .
Efficiency is not just a question of price .
If transport by rail becomes cheaper but not more efficient , we will not achieve that modal shift .
So we must combine efficiency with price if we are to deal with this matter adequately .
Finally , let me raise the subject of megaliners and standardisation .
We cannot prohibit , or even authorise , everything purely at European level .
We should work together properly with the Member States and find directives , for example in the fields of security and infrastructure , that must determine whether or not these megaliners should be tolerated .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , I should first like to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for her initiative .
Commissioner , I believe , in fact , that we are still not used to talking about logistics , either at European level or in the Member States .
Often we have a road policy , a railway policy , an aviation policy , a maritime policy , and in some countries we find it very difficult to coordinate them .
Logistics involve no more nor less than avoiding too many transfers between the different modes of transport and making sure that optimum use is made of them where they are most efficient or profitable .
In that respect , I think that the work started by Mrs Ayala Sender is very promising and we are , of course , looking forward to the Commission communication .
I should also like to reiterate the point made by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy .
In my view , not enough emphasis has been placed on the reports on the environmental aspects of the question .
Clearly we have to develop logistics in Europe and transport policy is an adjunct to the internal market and its development , but we cannot , on the one hand , have ambitious plans to reduce greenhouse gases and , on the other hand , be over-modest .
In that respect , I am concerned at the fact that 60-tonne lorries have been allowed to creep into all the reports .
An earlier report referred modestly to a European modular concept ; some reports talk about megatrucks and gigaliners , the theory of the road lobby being that the larger the lorry the less it will consume and the greater the saving .
That is untrue .
The larger the lorry , the more competitive it is compared with the rail and waterway transport , and the more the Commission policy on railways , waterways and motorways of the sea will be undermined .
It will not even be worth talking about any more .
There will still be just as many lorries , but what is certain is that there will be far more goods on the roads and we shall have failed .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , in its communication the Commission rightly says , and not for the first time , that logistics play an important part in our response to all manner of new challenges , on the environment for example .
Equally important , of course , is the role of logistics when it comes to the Union 's competitiveness .
Priority has to be given here to optimising the European transport system , addressing the problem of existing bottlenecks and applying advanced logistics .
Action is required .
How can we improve the efficiency of individual transport modes and combinations of those modes ?
That is the million-dollar question .
And I would emphasise here that the anticipated growth in freight transport needs to be addressed as pragmatically as possible .
If we are to cope with that level of growth , maximum use must be made of all modes of transport .
So it is emphatically not a matter of one or other but of all .
It is a pity that the House 's reaction to the communication threatened to get bogged down in a policy debate on whether or not these longer heavier vehicles - ecocombis or gigaliners - should be allowed , as Mr Savary said just now .
After a lot of pleading we now have agreement on a compromise which is as neutral as possible .
As someone who is in favour of these big , longer heavier vehicles , I would like to add one thing , and that is that calling for innovative ideas , only then to discard them on the basis of false arguments , will get us nowhere .
Base your decisions on proper research , that is what I say .
Once again , the anticipated growth of road freight transport will test us to the utmost .
Results in the immediate future will depend on how we prioritise existing obstacles .
Sacred cows will have to be sacrificed , including those surrounding longer heavier vehicles , for example , or the proliferation of driving bans in the European Union , the sacred cows over cabotage , and so on and so forth .
I sincerely hope these priorities will shortly be formulated more clearly in the European Commission 's Action Plan .
It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for her hard work .
I am leaving directly , not out of rudeness , but because I have an important meeting elsewhere .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I welcome the contents of this report today , which supports the broader development of trans-European road networks in Europe .
The second largest road development in Ireland at present is the construction of a 112 km road called the M3 , which will by-pass the towns of Dunshaughlin , Navan and Kells in County Meath .
There has been a lot of press coverage recently in Ireland about the role of the Commission in the context of the M3 .
Some people who oppose this development have totally misrepresented the role of the Commission in this matter .
I want to set the record straight as to the exact role of the Commission concerning the M3 .
On 29 June 2007 the Commission sent a letter by reasoned opinion to the Irish Government , seeking an explanation as to why the Irish Government did not carry out a second impact assessment when there was an archaeological discovery at Lismullen last March .
The Irish Government will defend its position because it acted only after independent reports from the Director of the National Museum of Ireland were given to the Irish Government .
This report recommended that this find at Lismullen be excavated and preserved by record .
This proposed plan of action was supported by the Chief State Archaeologist in Ireland .
However , the Commission sending a letter by reasoned opinion to the Irish Government does not mean , as has been reported , that Ireland is going to be fined hundreds of millions of euros by the European Union or that the building of this road , which has commenced , has to stop , or that legal action will be taken against Ireland .
I know that this is an emotive issue , but the role of the European Union in this issue has to be put into perspective .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a Green I am of course in favour of any improvements in logistics because that can help reduce environmental damage .
I must say from the outset , however , that there are few areas where the European Union really has the power to do anything in this regard .
There are always logistical weaknesses in areas where the link between different transport modes does not work ; this is particularly harmful when the railways cannot be used because the logistical links are cumbersome , bureaucratic , non-existent or poorly developed .
Even in cases where many transport modes run empty , however , we find that there is clearly a lack of logistics , or that it is simply not worthwhile to use the rolling stock in an efficient and targeted manner .
Those are crucial issues and they are indeed addressed in the dossier .
At the same time , they have been exploited by a number of lobbyists .
In my view , the improvement in infrastructure is not yet logistical ; we still see empty wagons even on very good roads or railways , which does not help us in any way .
In particular , I object to the fact that this dossier has been misused as a propaganda instrument for what are known as gigaliners .
We are already suffering from the fact that very poor use is made of the rolling stock .
Nonetheless , it is intended for reasons of economic self-interest - especially on the part of the timber industry , in the past at least - to introduce very large HGVs , which will adversely affect road maintenance .
After all , we must all realise that roads will need to be repaired far more frequently if even more weight is put on the axles , if even more weight presses on the asphalt surface .
That is why we cannot speak of environmental or economic improvement here , because in the end this also hugely distorts competition with the railways .
Mr President , far more freight is currently carried by road than is good for the quality of our air , our protection against excessive noise , our safety and the amount of space we need .
These transport operations continue to grow , especially as they have become relatively cheaper over the years .
Companies are organising more and more movements that are not necessary .
There are two reasons for this : the sourcing of raw materials , the various stages entailed in processing them and the sale of the end products are all handled at very different locations , and this generates a lot of unnecessary transport operations between those locations .
Despite the creation of main ports and other large distribution centres , goods still travel further than they need to .
In sparsely populated countries with few or no railways , most notably America and Australia , enormous road freight vehicles have developed , so-called road trains or rigs .
These keep the cost of road transport down , but they create far too many avoidable problems for everybody else .
We must not allow these heavy vehicles into Europe .
Freight transport has to be cut , and that which is really necessary must as far as possible go by rail or water .
Mr President , the importance of logistics to our society is well known .
Everyone involved has a duty to ensure that logistics operations proceed smoothly .
Public authorities make the operating framework as favourable as possible and business and industry devises concepts to meet market demand in the best way possible .
I am glad that the rapporteur mentions that and emphasises the various areas which need consideration .
Something which gave rise to much discussion as we dealt with this report is the question of these longer heavier freight vehicles or ' ecocombis ' .
Although practical tests at national level have yielded quite positive results , opinions on these vehicles differ .
To my mind the compromise is a good starting point for further debate .
I look forward to seeing what the European Commission will bring to this debate , both in its Freight Logistics Action Plan and in the study of vehicle weights and dimensions .
The study will be commissioned shortly and its findings will be published next summer .
To sum up briefly , my compliments to Mrs Ayala Sender on her report and I hope that the course embarked upon can be taken further later on in the year .
on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , for years now globalisation has landed us with rising expenditure on freight transport ; on top of that we have had enlargement eastward - together with a misdirected EU aid policy .
As a result , millions of vehicles are transporting freight every day , from private cars to HGVs , and the adverse effects such as congestion , noise , environmental pollution and fine dust pollution are escalating .
The concentration on road transport will no doubt exacerbate the existing problems in densely populated areas and on the main transport routes .
HGVs are far more often involved in accidents than other forms of transport and strict EU-wide rules on rest periods will make little difference .
Brussels does not take public health protection really seriously either , for there is no other explanation for the failure to transpose the Convention on the Protection of the Alps .
In fact the EU addressed those issues years ago , drawing up action plans and calling for transport to be shifted from road to rail .
Yet once again it did not managed to achieve any real results .
In regard to Trans-European Networks , we cannot continue to close our eyes to reality and , in the end , rolling country roads will have to become economically attractive .
( DE ) Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , let me point out that the Commission itself said that logistics is a matter for the industry itself .
I believe that is the right approach .
I hope , therefore , that when the Commission presents its action plan , it will divide it up into measures we can take as a Community , measures the Member States can take , and measures it is up to the industry itself to take .
Of course we have to reduce the red tape that is still an obstacle to coastal shipping , which has to fill in various forms , while HGVs can simply drive across the European Union .
We must indeed cut back government bureaucracy and promote modern transport infrastructure and systems .
Let us make no mistake , however .
Logistics is a matter for the industry itself and we should not take on a burden we simply cannot afford .
On gigaliners - perhaps it would be better to say either 60-tonners or 25m-long HGVs , for there are different categories - at this moment in time my Group is quite definitely against authorising their general use in transport .
After all , in most parts of the European Union infrastructure such as bridges , crossings and roundabouts are certainly not suitable for such long or heavy HGVs .
The State treasuries are not handing out any money for reinforcing the bridges or converting roundabouts .
Given that transport situation , gigaliners produce considerable transport safety problems .
Just imagine one of those 25-tonners coming round a bend in a small village , misjudging the bend and then trying to reverse !
I think , therefore , we should continue doing what we have done in the past .
We should authorise them in Finland and Sweden , which have huge open stretches for the transport of timber .
In that regard , the Committee on Transport and Tourism has made a sensible suggestion .
It says we should authorise these gigaliners in the Member States , but only subject to very stringent conditions , if we can show the Commission that the necessary transport security exists , that the necessary transport infrastructure exists .
That means we should check those conditions in individual cases and for individual countries .
( RO ) Mr President , Commissioner , Member States have to ensure a favourable environment for the development of freight transport logistics and to remove the barriers involved .
Both for carriers and for clients it is extremely important that freight arrives on time and under the established terms .
By 2020 a 50 % increase in freight transport is predicted .
Freight transport logistics represents 13 % of the Union 's gross domestic product and 10-15 % of the final cost for products is represented by the cost of transport logistics .
That is why Member States should facilitate freight transport and the rules and controls should be carried out on the basis of common norms , without introducing barriers to the free movement of goods .
These norms should be forwarded with priority to all the relevant carriers so that they can respect the regulatory provisions , and observe their contractual obligations ...
( The President interrupts the speaker )
The European Union has to use more environmentally-friendly means of transport .
It is no coincidence that 70 % of the priority projects for the development of the European transport network are meant for railways and waterways transport .
Unfortunately , Member States have made little use of the Marco Polo programme for the transfer of a larger volume of freight transport from the road to the sea transport system .
The navigable waterway made up of the Rhine , Main Channel and the Danube shortens the distance between the Northwestern and Southeastern Europe by 4 000 km .
Moreover , as of 2007 , the European Union has an exit to the Black Sea .
For freight transport logistics , intelligent transport systems and the use of technology become indispensable .
However , freight transport needs a good transport infrastructure and that is why we hope that the budgets relating to the Community and national transport projects will become a priority in the future .
I think that this report is extremely important for the economic development of the European Union .
Member States should do more for freight transport logistics .
Congratulations to the rapporteur .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , I am one of those people who believe that progress and welfare cannot be attained without ambitious objectives , but I also believe that we in the Community and the European Union have on too many occasions given ourselves grandiloquent and unrealistic agreements and objectives .
This is what I believe happened in 2000 with the Lisbon Strategy , which was going to make us the most competitive and dynamic world economy by 2010 ; or in 1994 with the Essen Agreements on trans-European networks , most of which are still pending .
In March this very year , the European Council set a target for a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption , whereas in reality we have proved incapable of attaining the much more modest targets to which we committed ourselves in Kyoto .
Now we are debating freight transport logistics in Europe as a key to sustainable mobility , a crucial element for our growth and development ; and given the significant growth in freight transport predicted by 2020 , logistics is something we cannot ignore as it is a necessary tool to increase the accessibility , efficiency and security of freight transport , as well as its sustainability .
However , at the same time it is necessary to correct persistent failures such as the bottleneck in the trans-European road network in the Biriatu Pass in the Basque Country , or other aspects where there are shortcomings such as the lack of corridors currently devoted to rail freight ( such corridors do not need to be high-speed in order to be competitive ) , or the poor interoperability of the railways , or the lack of efficient transhipment .
We must make intelligent transport systems possible , apply the potential offered by the Internet to the management of freight transport by standardising weights , dimensions and rules governing freight , reducing red-tape and establishing one-stop access points .
We must promote co-modality of the various modes of transport , not forgetting motorways of the sea and inland waterways ; most of all we must incorporate the real costs , including environmental costs , into the price of use .
All this cannot be achieved while reducing States ' contributions to the Community budget .
( DA ) Mr President , EU transport policy is on the wrong track .
Broadly speaking , nothing is being done about the key problems : climate change , congestion and accidents .
It is as though we have become inured to congestion and accidents - but we cannot be content to inure ourselves to climate change once it has begun .
We have to act now .
Yet traditional thinking prevails every time , even in this otherwise excellent report - which includes the absurd proposal to allow the use of megaliners .
What would happen if we allowed the use of these juggernauts of up to 60 tonnes ?
Would we have fewer lorries ?
Of course not .
The gain from increasing the size of lorries would be eaten up by the increase in transport tonnage .
That is a law of nature ; it is what happens when transport is cheaper .
Our roads would become full of these mobile warehouses , and neither ' intelligent ' traffic management nor any other hocus-pocus would be of any help .
It would be like applying small sticking plasters to a gaping wound , which will just become larger and larger with the present transport policy .
Ladies and gentlemen , I urge you to vote against the megaliners in paragraph 21 .
We cannot permit this kind of heavy goods vehicle in Europe .
We cannot make it cheaper to transport goods by road .
As mentioned earlier , this would undermine the competitiveness of maritime and rail transport : precisely the modes of transport that must be reinforced if we are ever to have sustainable freight transport in Europe .
( RO ) Mr President , this report is welcome as logistics is the key to economic development , and transport and mobility are the engine for sustainable development , and has to respond to the current imperative challenges , that is the need to decongest traffic and to fight against climate change .
Faced with the need for sustainable economic development and the need to reduce pollution , logistics , planning , exchange of best practices as well as efficient cooperation between all relevant players - authorities , producers , carriers , beneficiaries - are the only viable solutions .
Currently , both carriers and beneficiaries prefer the rapidity of roads and airways .
Unfortunately , the extreme heat this summer caused the introduction of traffic restrictions for heavy-load vehicles in certain regions , such as Romania , and thus freight transport traffic faced difficulties and financial losses were reported .
Under these circumstances , railway transport and above all internal navigable waterways and short sea routes , as well as comodality , have undoubted advantages for decreasing the pressure on road infrastructures .
It is mandatory to resurrect the debate on co-financing the Transeuropean transport networks because , in order to make these massive investments in European infrastructure , national financial efforts , irrespective of their significance and however well-intentioned they may be , are insufficient especially in the case of the new Member States .
The Commission has to bear in mind and to allocate more funds as of 2008 .
I would focus on the importance of the rapporteur 's recommendation towards Member States to draw up national action plans for freight transport logistics , together with the European general action plan .
Within these national plans , major importance should be attached to crossborder transport to and from third countries , as well as to the security of cargoes .
These plans can successfully contribute to the improvement of priority management and to the absorbtion of Structural and Cohesion Fund financingmeant to improve and enlarge transport infrastructure , as well as to a better cooperation between the TEN and Marco Polo projects at crossborder level .
( PL ) Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Ayala Sender on her excellent report .
I would like to raise two specific issues : firstly , I too welcome the points made in the report about the European Commission 's intention to investigate the possibility of creating a single transport document for all modes of transport .
This is a very interesting announcement , which could support interoperability and promote multimodal transport , does not require investment expenditure and could help in integrating us to a great extent .
The second issue , which I also consider to be particularly important , is the creation of a system of training and further training in the areas of transport and logistics in order to create a system for the mutual recognition of skills and competences ; this is in reference to paragraph 17 .
I would definitely like to support this concept for the reasons given above .
The third issue that I would like to raise is Schengen and , more specifically , how the new Member States are to introduce its principles in practice .
( FR ) Mr President , I should also like to thank Mrs Ayala Sender for the excellent work that , at the time Parliament is discussing this type of work , has resulted in this own-initiative report on freight transport logistics in Europe , a very important subject for our fellow citizens , as has often been said .
Since I have to be quick , two main points .
The first is that it is more essential than ever to take logistics into account in our overall goods transport strategy and we must pay particular attention to urban logistics and logistical problems in towns .
The second point , and here I am speaking as a member of the Committee on Budgets , is that European Union investment must include the financing of logistical infrastructures .
We know how disappointed we were about the amounts of the appropriations allocated to the RTE-T and I am counting on the support of the Commissioner in ensuring that the Member States make a greater contribution - at any rate managing to persuade them - when the financial perspectives are renegotiated .
Finally , I should like to draw attention to the views expressed on gigaliners , lorries weighing over 60 tonnes , being driven on European roads .
As very many of my colleagues have pointed out this evening , these are not in line with European objectives for safety or environmental protection or sustainable development .
( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , logistics processes are a matter chiefly for industry and the transport sector and in my view that is how it should stay .
They are considerations featuring prominently on the agenda in Europe and indeed worldwide and for that reason we welcome the Commission 's proposal .
But efforts need to be concentrated on securing a better framework for transport and fewer obstacles rather than on yet more European rules or prohibitions .
The rules do need to be tidied up .
So I am happy that in this regard we have significantly streamlined the rapporteur 's draft report .
Let me say a little more about the obstacles to logistics .
Last year in this House we debated the Naiades report .
We are fully behind the Commission on this , because there are a lot of obstacles to inland waterway transport too , and I hope the Commission will lose no time in laying its first proposals before Parliament .
Another obstacle to logistics is the restriction on these 60-tonne vehicles .
I support the compromise , namely that Member States must be able to decide whether or not they apply this , but I am also aware that there are an awful lot of myths , not to say mega-myths , doing the rounds on this subject .
You are having a study conducted , Commissioner .
I urge you above all to study the facts and I also urge you to study the international routes .
I agree with my fellow Member Mr Jarzembowski that we must not allow these gigaliners into our towns and villages .
But over long-haul routes where there is no alternative , fine .
So will you look at the facts ?
I await your conclusions with interest .
( HU ) I would like to thank my colleague , Mrs Ayala Sender , for an excellent report .
She has prepared some comprehensive material covering all areas , which will help in the drafting of the Commission Action Plan .
It is an investment in the future of the European economy for timely , effective freight transport logistics to be put in place throughout the whole of the EU .
Its existence will contribute to sustainable economic development , improved competitiveness and regional development .
However , to achieve this goal we need ever higher quality , more punctual , effective and secure logistics and , most importantly , harmonisation of transport methods so that the efficiency and the benefits of individual methods can be used to full advantage .
This requires the creation of the right technical , practical and economic conditions .
Impact assessments relying on a unified strategy for logistics development are required .
It is important to separate the roles of the state and the private sector .
Efficient logistics is the key to sustainable mobility .
Mature logistics solutions contribute to the optimisation of freight transport , and so it is also useful to look at opportunities for research and development support for developments in logistics .
( PT ) With this initial report , on which the rapporteur is to be congratulated , we hope to contribute to the definition of a strategic framework for freight transport logistics in the European Union .
We consider logistics to be an essential tool for the effective planning and implementation of a balanced and sustainable use of the various means of transport .
Logistics are consequently central to a process of rationalisation for the purpose of achieving the most competitive and sustainable levels in the future .
Despite the advantages conferred by a modern system of logistics in the areas of economic efficiency and competitiveness , optimum use of resources , creation of employment opportunities , protection of the environment and improvement of safety and security , we recognise that there are still problems to be solved , one of the most obvious being the chronic underfunding of the TENs , including the development of freight transport logistics .
It is therefore essential to explore alternative sources of funding via private-public initiatives , the EIB , the Structural Funds , etc .
Another timely point raised in the report is the need for the Commission Action Plan , mentioned earlier , to provide measures to fight organised crime in international freight transport and ensure the security of freight transport loadings against theft , robbery and hijacking .
It is for the public authorities to regulate these and other matters , and to facilitate multimodal freight transport , which is essentially a business activity .
Measures such as ' one stop administrative shopping ' and cutting red tape reduce costs and pave the way for a sounder and more competitive economy in the sector .
Given the high growth rates in freight transport that are expected , the future role of logistics will be crucial to achieving an efficient , sustainable , accessible and safe transport system .
To this extent , we are sure that logistics will make an increasingly essential contribution to achieving the Lisbon goals .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , efficient freight transport logistics is crucial to territorial cohesion .
So says Ms Ayala , whom I wish to congratulate on her sound and thorough report .
In view of this I would like to ask the Commission to pay special attention to the specific problems faced by island territories , for which maritime transport is of particular importance .
Simplifying procedures , tackling the problems of island ports such as the excessive costs produced by market limitations , or how to facilitate new infrastructures through trans-European networks and the Structural and Cohesion Funds : these are measures which would contribute to improving the economic development and competitiveness of islands .
I would like to close by asking the Commission to give special consideration to the needs which being an island presents in the forthcoming action plan on transport logistics which it is to present .
( DE ) Mr President , as transport policy stands today , Europe is aiming at more transport software , i.e. more intelligent solutions to improve efficiency , but also to serve the interests of the environment and health protection .
We will not go into the detailed reasons for this change , although surely it has much to do with the fact that we do not have the money for large new infrastructure projects - see , for instance , the rather modest funds allocated to the TENs and suchlike .
Under these circumstances it is most important to ensure that new hardware is not let in through the back door on Austrian and European transport routes .
I , like a number of others , am referring to the 60-tonners or gigaliners or whatever we call them .
At any rate , they can certainly not be authorised in an infrastructure that is not appropriate for them ; they might be a good solution on flat land where there is little traffic , but they would be totally misplaced in mountainous and densely built-up areas .
Austria in particular is in no way equipped for superweight trucks .
Over the past few months we have seen again and again what they mean in terms of bridge construction and the weight they can bear .
We have no interest whatsoever in landing ourselves with new problems here .
It is not in the interests of transport policy either , and especially not in the interest of health and environmental policy .
If we cannot produce any extra European funds to pay for the external costs of the existing infrastructure , then we should leave things as they are or , in this concrete case , leave the gigaliners in northern Finland .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for joining with your rapporteur in emphasising the importance of logistics , not only from the economic point of view but also environmentally and socially .
I think it is unanimously agreed that logistics should be developed and made more efficient , more environmentally friendly .
That is made very clear in the report by Mrs Ayala Sender , which I welcome .
A number of the wishes you have expressed , which I have listened to very carefully this afternoon , will be incorporated in the Action Plan for Logistics that will be coming out by the end of October .
Since I really do not have enough time to reply at length , I shall just refer to the rules on the size of lorries .
That is certainly one of the most controversial issues and we shall not be able to debate it fully today .
I shall simply make a few comments .
It is a fact that , although we hope to see much more of a modal shift in the future , at present most goods are carried by road .
We have to assess any measures that might improve the efficiency of that mode of transport and reduce its impact on the environment .
The assessment should also cover the rules on the size of lorries , Directive 96 / 53 . I think any amendments have to be considered very carefully , because they might have complex repercussions .
We need to examine the effects that wider or heavier lorries might have on the infrastructure , safety , the environment , the system of shippers and carriers , and intermodal competition .
As I said , I feel that we should give these questions very serious consideration .
My services will therefore be embarking on research to evaluate experiences .
On the basis of its results , we shall be able to discuss all the nuances of this very important issue , which must not be treated lightly .
That is my first point and I shall wind up very quickly , too quickly for my liking , but I appreciate that Parliament has a timetable .
The second important issue in the work on logistics is infrastructures .
Reference has been made to the financing of infrastructures .
I should like to draw attention to the new Marco Polo II Programme , which will enable us to finance logistical solutions favouring the modal shift or the reduction in traffic .
Finally , training .
The last speaker , Mr Rack , said that a new culture has to be developed .
That is indeed what is necessary and we always come back to the men and women working in the transport business , who need to master a whole range of new skills if transport is really to be made more efficient and mobility more sustainable , in other words more environmentally friendly .
I thank Parliament very much and I shall take full account of this report and the subsequent debate .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Single European Sky ( debate )
The next item is the oral question to the Commission on building the single European sky through functional airspace blocks final ) by Paolo Costa , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism - B6-0135 / 2007 ) .
author . - ( FR ) Mr President , I must first render the things that are SESAR 's unto SESAR , or to another Italian , Paolo Costa , who is actually the author of this written question and has asked me to stand in for him and put it to you in his absence .
This is an oral question to the Commission with debate on the creation of functional airspace blocks for building the Single European Sky , in other words , the intentions of the Commission regarding the implementation , or progress to date in the implementation of the package of texts which were the subject of conciliation in December 2003 , ' the Single Sky package '
One of the texts provided for the creation of functional airspace blocks , in other words airline routes at the various airspace levels , in order to optimise consumption , reduce greenhouse gases and if possible reduce congestion at the busiest airports , not forgetting the possibility of bringing down air transport costs .
This is a particularly sensitive issue , with reservations on the part of the Member States , which have always reaffirmed their sovereignty over their airspace .
That is especially true of the Member States - and I know of one that is dear to me , my own country - which have large military forces and military airspace blocks reserved in a virtually discretionary fashion .
Mr Costa is concerned that , as we might have feared , no progress has been made , as far as he can see , on that text on the creation of airspace blocks , one of the four on the Single Sky , and it has met with strong resistance from the Member States .
Mr Costa is therefore putting the following question to the Commission .
The Commission has just produced a communication making it clear that the cost of not having functional airspace blocks for building a Single European Sky is about EUR 1 billion .
Mr Costa has put an initial question : is the Commission satisfied with that situation and does it believe that the introduction of Regulation ( EC ) No 551 / 2004 on airspace organisation is progressing satisfactorily ?
How does the Commission account for the fact that no new functional airspace blocks have become operational since the Regulation came into force ?
Article 10 of the Regulation provides for an extension of airspace organisation to lower airspace and requires the Commission to determine any other steps that might be necessary ' in the light of progress achieved ' .
In view of that , what changes does the Commission think should be made to existing legislation ?
Finally , does the Commission agree that it should not wait until the end of 2008 before bringing forward a proposal to that effect ?
Finally - there is more than one question in the oral question - Mr Costa is asking whether the Commission agrees that the ' bottom up ' approach , whereby the initiative to create functional airspace blocks is left to the Member States , has failed and that a more proactive approach by the European Union is now required ?
I think , and I hope I have remained true to its spirit , that that is the question Mr Costa is putting to the Commission .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr Savary , I thank you and , through you , Mr Costa , because I think this question has been very well put and the problem it raises is a real one .
The reform in March 2004 was intended to organise air traffic in line with operational requirements , not national borders .
It is a way of shortening flights and avoiding aircraft flying around unnecessarily .
I shall answer each of the questions .
The first concerns the cost of air traffic management and the repercussions for the Single Sky .
You and Mr Costa have just quoted the key figure of EUR 1 billion if the Single Sky is not implemented , and I might add that , according to Eurocontrol , the potential savings are even greater , since EUR 3 billion could be saved .
In addition to the reduction in airline costs , a saving of two billion would be achieved through the improved efficiency of aviation services .
It is true that , as Mr Savary says , completion of the Single European Sky is not progressing quickly enough , given the importance of the objectives : competitiveness , sustainable development , combating climate change and promoting safety in the air .
Should we , for that reason , stand there with our arms folded and do nothing ?
No .
For the first time , the adoption of basic rules on the Single Sky has given the Community real powers in this area .
The 2004 reform has been implemented : separation between regulation and the provision of services , certification of providers in accordance with European rules , air traffic controllers ' licences and a range of technical measures adopted by comitology .
Lastly , there has been the launch of the SESAR industrial project , a real addition to the Single Sky .
But we need to move faster .
The Commission must take stock of what has been done .
Back in December 2006 , I consulted a group of high-level experts and this July they presented their report to me on the reforms that are imperative .
The Commission will be submitting a communication based on that this autumn .
The second question relates to functional airspace blocks .
It is true that in the 2004 reform the Council opted for a bottom-up approach , with action by the national governments on the creation of the blocks .
Frankly , that was not an entirely satisfactory approach , because it limited the possibilities for the Commission and the Community institutions to ensure that the blocks were actually created and that work at local level did not become bogged down .
Another part of the problem is that insufficient stress was placed on improving the economic efficiency of the service provided .
We are going to try and introduce a performance-based approach by the first half of 2008 .
That would set specific performance targets for service providers and provide for incentives and intervention mechanisms in the event of non-completion .
I believe that that performance-based approach will speed up the creation of functional blocks , because they will be essential to the achievement of the performance targets .
We are working on the idea of a performance review body and a coordinator responsible for developing the projects more quickly .
I personally think that a coordinator of the kind we have for the trans-European networks would be very useful in speeding up the creation of these functional blocks that we need .
We shall not , of course , be waiting until 2009 to accelerate the creation and efficiency of the functional blocks .
I would hope to present you with an initiative by the middle of 2008 .
It is generally agreed that the blocks can only be effective if upper and lower airspace are regarded as indivisible .
Lastly , the fourth question , the bottom-up approach of the Member States , which , it must be admitted , has in some ways been a failure .
In that case , should we adopt exactly the opposite approach ?
I am not sure .
I think we still have to try and make the best of the bottom-up approach , but in order to develop a Single Sky we need to move on to a second stage , based on performance , on mechanisms .
We have to cooperate actively with the Member States to encourage political commitment and exercise pressure from above to develop functional airspace blocks .
That is why this question was so welcome .
It has given me an opportunity to explain the main initiatives we shall be taking , which are in line with the very pertinent comments made by Mr Savary .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , we have no problems at all with what you have achieved in terms of improving efficiency in airspace , but your reply was quite clear .
That reply was to the effect that Member States have not done their homework .
Member States have not met the obligation that has existed since 2004 rapidly to create functional airspace blocks .
On the one hand that results in the costs you referred to of up to EUR 3 billion , and on the other hand it also leads to environmental pollution .
At the moment , we are discussing the introduction of emission trading in air transport , talking about 3 % of air transport emissions .
If we had sensible , rapid and efficient air transport management we could reduce fuel consumption by up to 12 % , which would substantially reduce CO2 emissions .
Mr Vice-President , you are a gentleman , but let us get to the crux of the matter : the Member States are not doing their homework .
That is why we - you as the Commission and we as Parliament - must all tell the Member States : detention time !
You have to catch up quickly now after falling so far behind .
Yet that may not be enough .
We must also threaten them with changing the bottom-up- , bottom-down approach .
If Member States cannot manage to make progress on the truly vital question of air safety , air efficiency , the impact of air transport on the climate , then we expect that in 2008 the Commission will not just present a report saying that the Member States are improving in terms of creating airspace blocks , but that it will threaten the Member States .
You can rely on our help .
Then we will have to change the system and create the airspace blocks at European level .
That is the stick we need in order to persuade Member States rapidly to create efficient , functional airspace blocks .
I know how difficult that is , but kind words will get us nowhere .
We must slowly begin to wave the big stick .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I am so long in this Parliament that I recall the occasion when Commissioner de Palacio first proposed the Single European Sky and the term ' functional airspace blocks ' first entered EU vocabulary .
Well , after a painful birth , progress was made in 2004 with the regulation that enacted these airspace blocks , but I have to say that since then progress has been painfully slow , particularly in regard to the extension of those airspace blocks and specifically as regards lower airspace .
I appreciate , Commissioner , that it was the Commission 's intention to work with Member States and no doubt some Member States have proved to be less willing to pursue this policy at the pace that we would like or , indeed , had envisaged , but surely the time is now right to find the accelerator pedal and for the Commission now to come forward with a directive as soon as possible .
Since 2004 , no new airspace blocks have been created and , as we have heard from previous speakers , the cost of that in our failure to create a Single European Sky is estimated to be at EUR 1 billion .
In addition , the existing legislation is in need of updating and the travelling public are still faced on a daily basis with air traffic delays , due to the antiquated attitudes of Member States and what appears to be inactivity by the Commission .
Patience is running out , and action is needed urgently .
Failure to act is not an option , which is why my Group will support the oral question placed before Parliament by Mr Costa , on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
Commissioner , we are all growing older and we would like to see the Single European Sky in our lifetime .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( GA ) Mr President , I should like to ask whether this aviation liberalisation policy can be considered in any way to be helping certain regions and regional airports .
Look , for example , at what is happening at Shannon Airport in my own constituency in the west of Ireland .
Aer Lingus 's decision to discontinue flights to London has adversely affected the region , not least economically .
It is totally contrary to Irish government policy .
To my mind , then , as far as Europe 's regions are concerned , this freedom in aviation matters will help strong areas to progress , but weaken those which are not so strong .
I would therefore ask the Commission to look at the case of , say , Shannon Airport , and consider how this policy can be pursued alongside regional development policy in such areas .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Mr Chairman , ladies and gentlemen , the ' Single European Sky ' initiative confirms my experience as a private pilot that aviation is a textbook example of an area that calls for supranational cooperation irrespective of state borders .
For that reason , and in view of the need to ensure maximum air traffic safety , maximum effectiveness and minimum flight delays , we support the creation of functional blocks and , consequently , the Single European Sky .
However , let us not forget that while fragmentation is expensive , defragmentation costs money too .
Since this is a complex system , I support , in the interest of continuity , the gradual establishment of a single operations management system in a common airspace .
In addition , the unification of European skies where 27 national operating systems exist today will jeopardise the jobs of air traffic controllers and other specialists in this field .
As far as I am aware , a rather successful long-term social dialogue has been conducted on these issues and , in my opinion , it is thus necessary to reconcile seemingly contradictory procedures .
We want our flights to be safer and more effective ; we want minimal flight delays and maximum elimination of the dangers of unusual air traffic events .
Human lives are at stake : the lives of those who fly and also the lives and fates of those who manage the air traffic .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , I am disturbed by the suggestion that the process of establishing open skies be accelerated .
There seems to be no recognition of the problems that open skies have visited on regional airports in Europe , even in their preparatory stage .
In creating a single European sky we will see the emergence of two major hubs - Heathrow , definitely , and either Frankfurt or Charles de Gaulle - flanked by a network of sub-hubs .
The competition among airports to be the first or second level in the open skies hierarchy is proving cut-throat in my country .
Shannon Airport - a hub in its own right - and regional airports like Cork are being starved of routes , while Dublin Airport is chronically overcrowded .
My government stands by and does nothing because the logic of open skies is to let the market decide , and the market , not social responsibility or common sense around regional and rural development , is deciding in a way that increases profits but does not serve people .
Rather than rush open skies , let us , even at this late hour , take whatever time is necessary to do serious assessment on the impact of the policy .
Then let us take whatever measures are needed to ensure that whole areas of Europe , like the west and south of Ireland , are not cut off from a viable , economic future by open skies .
( DE ) Madam President , we all share the same concern regarding European transport policy .
We want to improve the efficiency of all modes of transport , and especially air transport , without at the same time increasing environmental pollution .
If possible , we even want to improve the environmental balance of flying .
We have had many ideas on the subject in Europe , such as emission trading .
We hope to achieve our aims by , for example , possibly taxing aircraft fuel and suchlike .
That may not be the wrong approach , but the way to achieve our aim is a different one .
As in the case of road transport , we should seek more intelligent solutions .
The idea of an open European sky and a Single European Sky is the right approach , although of course it needs to be implemented .
SESAR is a step on the way but we must do more in this respect .
Let me address a final point because we will be voting on the subject this week .
Congestion is found not just in the sky , but on the ground too , especially in airports .
Let us , therefore , get rid of the senseless , bureaucratic rules on carrying fluids at airports .
That would save a lot of money and a lot more trouble .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , we regard the Single European Sky as the most important project for the future of air transport .
The Commission always emphasised its importance under your predecessor and I also believe it to be the case .
We adopted the 2004 package of regulations .
We still have a kind of patchwork in the sky , with 58 national airspace blocks , even though we know we would really only need one , or to be generous perhaps three to six .
We know that this patchwork - the figures were given earlier - has adverse effects on safety , and of course also on the economy and consumers .
We know about the stacking and congestion in the skies and nowadays we are putting far more emphasis on emissions .
We have realised that we can take a big step forward here .
In its progress report , the Commission showed how slowly the Member States are moving , even if there are some initiatives , and proposed a few ways of exerting pressure .
Now I am not saying that is meaningless , nor ' I told you so ' , but as early as 2003 we said the bottom-up approach would not work , because even at that time we suspected that Member States would get embroiled in discussions about areas of sovereignty in regard to service provision and that such crucial matters need to be regulated by top-down legislative rules .
At the time we thought perhaps Eurocontrol could propose rules and make a proposal based simply on the substance , on functionality , which the Member States could then quarrel about , rather than waiting until they themselves had created another kind of patchwork , in a bottom-up approach .
What is important now is seriously to consider whether we need to review the legal framework .
That would be the only way to exert real pressure and bring about the necessary changes .
( PL ) Madam President , Commissioner , in the spring of 2004 , when the European Union was adopting the relevant legislation , there was talk of the benefits that civil aviation would obtain from the reorganisation of air traffic rules and military cooperation with the civil sector in this regard .
The European system at that time was very fragmented , which resulted in there being narrow airspace corridors .
As a result there was a worsening in the safety of flights , and about 20 % of aircraft were delayed , more fuel was being used , which had a negative ecological impact .
Is the situation any better today , Commissioner ?
Why have the so-called ' functional airspace blocks ' not begun to function ?
Is this just the fault of individual Member States ?
Or perhaps our laws did not meet actual requirements ?
It would be good to have a prompt response to these questions and to take remedial steps now , and not wait to the end of 2008 .
Growth in air traffic is phenomenal .
What are needed therefore are appropriate legal regulations , but regulations that do not just remain empty words .
What is also required is appropriate staff training .
And finally , how do you see this issue in the context of the EU 's neighbours , Commissioner ?
( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with what other speakers have already said and I would add that the Single European Sky needs to be completed as a matter of urgency .
It is clear that the softly-softly approach of Regulation 551 / 2004 , designed to encourage Member States to make optimum use of these more functional airspace blocks , has not worked .
I understand too that this is largely because many Member States are holding back , they prefer not to be involved , stress their sovereignty , and so forth , but we must not allow them to get away with that .
Aviation is very much a sector which needs to be dealt with in every particular at the European level , in the interests of the industry , consumers , safety and the environment .
At a time when climate change is so high on the political agenda , Commissioner , we cannot have aircraft making unnecessary detours , wasting huge amounts of aviation fuel , and so on .
We simply must push ahead with this dossier , along with other instruments - SESAR , the emissions trading system , and so forth .
We cannot go on allowing tens of millions of euros to be wasted due to inefficient management of our airspace by a whole lot of unnecessary air traffic control centres .
There is plenty of scope for trimming and pruning here and that is what we want .
It is likely , moreover , that we shall soon reach the limits of capacity thanks to the sector 's rapid expansion .
Existing bilateral contacts aimed at forming functional airspace blocks have achieved hardly anything , so we really do need to pull our finger out .
Appointing a coordinator and a performance review body would seem to be a step in the right direction , but at the same time , Commissioner , I fear that this bottom-up approach will not be enough ; we have taken it as far as we can and we must now look to take new legislative initiatives .
( RO ) Madam President , in 2006 , low-cost companies opened 225 new European airways routes , meaning 1 800 new flights per week .
The fragmentation of airspace at national level , with specific operational rules and procedures , may have negative effects on the safety of transport capability , on the introduction of new technologies and on costs .
While passing from one air sector to another , pilots change frequency and contact the next air traffic controller .
Air traffic control has become a critical element .
It is important that new functional blocks be implemented following consultation of all the relevant parties , and Member States take effective actions in order to achieve an integrated management system .
Meanwhile , investments should be made in more efficient aircrafts and airport infrastructure .
Romania and Bulgaria 's accession to the EU adds new functional blocks for the Community airspace , with relevance both for the Black Sea region and for cooperation in the Balkans .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Madam President , I appreciate and share the impatience expressed by Parliament .
I shall give you a very precise but very concise answer .
Ladies and gentlemen , you will have a report in October 2007 and a second package of legislation by the middle of 2008 , so it certainly cannot be said that we are not doing anything !
We are therefore going to answer this question in detail together .
The second point : I have probably spoken to you about a coordinator , a senior political figure who will promote the introduction of these operational blocks between the Member States .
I must say that the results achieved in the trans-European networks indicate to me that this would be a useful way of stepping up our action in this area .
I shall reply to the third question by referring to Sesar , because Sesar exists , it is already a joint enterprise that brings together all the participants .
I believe that the introduction of Sesar will overturn all the bad habits that were keeping us confined to airspaces defined by national borders , which are no longer sensible .
Thus I am giving a very positive reply to the question put by Mr Costa and discussed by Mr Savary and have listened carefully to what Parliament wants .
I am ready to do all I can to respond .
The debate is now closed .
Written statement ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( CS ) The Member States agreed to set up common airspace blocks to control a single sky , irrespective of national borders .
Prior to that two planes collided over Germany and 71 people perished .
The arguments for a single sky are growing stronger : we have 57 control points for 28 000 daily flights ; the US has two .
Three years later we are no further on .
The EU has not put all of the Regulations from 2004 into practice .
These Regulations were supposed to integrate airspace in the internal services market and provide a basis for an effective operating system with emphasis on safety , the environment and increased flying capacity .
We currently have 65 radar centres with 31 systems using 22 computer networks , and we expect that the number of flights over Europe will double in 10 years ' time .
Do the citizens know that their governments and parliaments are ignoring the benefits of common Europe to their disadvantage ?
Why does the process of creating a shared operating airspace for both civilian and military flights over a united Europe take such a long time ?
Is it to appease local economic interests ?
Is it to protect national sovereignty , to the detriment of transport safety and at high prices ?
Today we want to know how and when we are going to integrate the classification of the upper airspace and how are we going to jointly operate the lower airspace in the future .
Can obstacles to the creation of functional blocks over European territory be identified openly ?
Is it possible to shed light on the political will of Member States to fulfil their obligations ?
We are also worried about the failure of the bottom-up approach because in three years the Member States have not developed the functional blocks needed for more efficient control of the sky .
Commission Question Time
The next item is Question Time ( B6-0138 / 2007 ) .
The following questions are addressed to the Commission
Part one
Subject : Forced labour in Europe
Trafficking in people for purposes of exploitative forced labour has been on the rise in recent years in the EU .
The victims , whether European citizens or immigrants , are suffering under new forms of slavery .
What action does the Commission intend to take to put an end to this phenomenon ?
Since such trafficking is facilitated by Member States ' failure to ensure employers ' compliance with the legislation on labour and workers ' rights , what measures will the Commission take to tackle this problem ?
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , forced labour and trafficking for labour exploitation are gross violations of fundamental rights and we are fully committed to preventing and combating such crimes .
According to estimates from international labour organisations , in 2005 there were at least 12.3 million people in forced labour worldwide .
About a fifth of these have been trafficked .
Trafficking for labour exploitation is mostly an organised crime business and creates an estimated 12 billion dollars per year .
We also know that trafficking is still a low-risk crime .
European strategy aims to move it from being low-risk , high-reward to high-risk , low-reward .
An integrated strategy against trafficking for labour exploitation is needed which comprises prevention , prosecution , protection and assistance to victims .
The Commission will play the role of facilitator to establish a network of all the stakeholders and institutions involved in a preventive strategy .
First of all , labour inspection services , employers ' organisations , trade unions .
In relation to prevention , the major goal is ensuring the respect of labour laws in all the work places and therefore fighting against illegal labour , especially in the sectors which are more at risk , including agriculture , construction , food-processing and domestic work .
I am also committed to developing new legislation on combating trafficking in human beings and labour exploitation of migrant workers .
The recent proposal for a directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally resident third country nationals is an example .
This proposal aims at fighting more effectively the exploitation of migrant workers through dissuasive administrative sanctions and through penal sanctions in the most serious cases , including trafficking , and where particularly exploitative working conditions are found .
Investigation and prosecution should become more effective .
Law enforcement officials should fully apply the legislation against trafficking in the field of labour exploitation , including legislation complying with the framework decision on trafficking and the directive on residence permits for victims of trafficking .
As national good practice shows , measures to provide assistance for trafficked persons are crucial to protect their fundamental rights and simultaneously promote successful prosecution .
The granting of assistance , residence status and support to find a better alternative for labour and life will secure the cooperation of trafficked persons in criminal proceedings and make it easier to punish the perpetrators .
In conclusion , on the occasion of the first Anti-Trafficking Day on 18 October next , the Commission will draw up recommendations with and for Member States on identification and support of victims - first of all vulnerable categories like children - based on close cooperation between law enforcement , prosecutors ' offices and NGOs and other service providers .
( RO ) Madam President , please allow me to thank Commissioner Frattini for his answer .
Since the time I submitted my question , I met the Commissioner and we discussed aspects of the trafficking in people .
I deeply appreciate the involvement of the European Commission and of the Commissioner himself in the fight against this phenomenon and I am glad that on 18 October , the European Commission will launch actual actions to stop this phenomenon , including those mentioned by the Commissioner , i.e. introducing criminal sanctions for serious cases of moonlighting .
I would like to ask if the Commissioner intends , on behalf of the European Commission , to request a mandate from the Council for signing , on behalf of the European Communities , the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings , a very efficient legal instrument for combating the trafficking in human beings .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the answer is certainly yes .
We are , and I am personally , committed to ensuring that all the international instruments see Europe as an actor and as a protagonist .
As regards the instrument to which you referred , as well as the other concrete initiatives , the Commission undoubtedly cannot , ladies and gentlemen , do everything alone .
I should like to propose a directive on the criminal punishment of profiteers , or rather slave-traders , who use and abuse the victims of trafficking , but unless the Member States give their consent , unless the network of small , large and medium-sized enterprises in Europe supports us , such instruments will be much less effective .
What I am therefore appealing for is for us to work together .
( DE ) EURO 2008 will be held in Austria and Switzerland next year .
The people traffickers and traffickers in women are already prepared for it .
Is the Commission also prepared ?
Vice-President of the Commission . - It is a very important question .
We had quite a good experience during the 2006 football World Cup in Germany .
We worked together in very close cooperation with all the Member States , police authorities and German authorities .
We were able to prevent at least 3 000 or 4 000 young victims from being trafficked in Germany during that period of time .
We are ready to do the same .
We are preparing a report , which will be published very shortly , on the very important results of European cooperation .
You may know that at least 12 Member States have been cooperating in adopting measures to block and to control at the borders suspect people who are trying to illegally bring in young victims of this trafficking .
We are ready to do the same next year in cooperation with Germany , Austria and Switzerland , which will also host championships .
Germany did a very good job on this .
( LT ) The phenomenon whereby people are taken and forcibly employed and whereby they are deprived of freedom of movement and any activity , whereby it is impossible to leave one 's job , as in a prison , is a very old one .
We know about this from the media and from various inquiries .
Has the Commission any generalised , statistical information on the countries in which this has occurred , and do you not think this is a matter of criminal law ?
A Member State has no right to refrain from punishing offenders who deprive others of their freedom .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are certainly aware of the most worrying developments .
We are also aware that some Member States are intensifying their cooperation on prevention and repression .
The way in which these criminal offences are defined is , however , a problem which , in my view , is Europe-wide .
When , as you said , people are forced to work in atrocious conditions , they are held hostage , and we cannot merely punish those responsible under the rules governing illegal work , since such criminal offences also have to be seen as the enslavement of other human beings .
Only in that way can we improve the situation .
To cite an example : only if we define such crimes in the serious way which I feel they deserve , will we then be able to apply the European arrest warrant .
This is an essential prerequisite .
Subject : Action against international crime and the European Court of Justice
The development of the European Union has taken place on the basis of applying legislation , but the recent concern to act against international crime has led to the adoption of decisions under the third pillar , i.e. on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation , without them being submitted as they should to scrutiny by the European Court of Justice .
Does the Commission believe it is possible to strengthen the juridical scrutiny of third-pillar actions , in the interests of greater legal certainty in the Union ?
Vice-President of the Commission . - Madam President , the European Court of Justice plays an important role in safeguarding the legality , implementation and application of third pillar instruments .
Under Article 35 of the Treaty , the Court has jurisdiction , upon request of a Member State 's court or tribunal , to give preliminary rulings on the validity or interpretation of framework decisions and decisions , on the interpretation of conventions established under Title VI of the Treaty , and on the validity and interpretation of the measures implementing them .
However , this jurisdiction only exists for those Member States which have declared that they accept the jurisdiction of the Court .
Moreover , those Member States , having accepted the jurisdiction , may limit it to the highest national courts or tribunals .
At this moment , unfortunately , only 16 Member States have accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court to give preliminary rulings on third pillar instruments , and two of them have made a limitative statement .
This is really insufficient in my view and does not allow for appropriate dialogue between the Court and the national courts applying European law on a daily basis .
In addition , the European Court has jurisdiction to review the legality of framework decisions and decisions .
Both Member States and the Commission may bring an action before the European Court to challenge the legality of these measures .
In practice , the Commission has made use of this possibility twice .
I refer to the cases regarding the request for annulment of the framework decision concerning the application of criminal law with respect to the protection of the environment and ship source pollution .
But , in my view , these provisions also need improvement .
In particular , the present Treaty does not provide for a mechanism similar to the infringement procedures for Community legislation , in order to monitor the implementation of the instruments in Member States ' legislation .
I have expressed my view on the gaps with respect to the jurisdiction of the Court in the area of freedom , security and justice in two communications I submitted to the Commission in 2006 and July 2007 on the implementation of the Hague programme .
The Commission therefore welcomes the mandate agreed by the Member States for an intergovernmental conference to finalise details of a reformed treaty .
Under the reformed treaty , I would expect the Court of Justice to become fully responsible in all justice , freedom and security areas .
This is important to tackle poor national implementation of previously agreed work .
( ES ) Madam President , the Commissioner has replied as I anticipated , as I am aware of the value he places on the institutions of the rule of law .
The problem is that the Constitutional Treaty is still at an indeterminate point : we do not know if we will succeed in concluding it and in the meantime we must operate in this Community , tackling terrorist crimes on the one hand and on the other ensuring legal certainty .
The question I would raise with the Commissioner is , in the light of the lack of will on the part of some States to take on commitments before the Court of Justice , whether he believes it is appropriate for us to continue to adopt anti-terrorist measures if at the same time such measures are not coupled with a strengthening of the courts .
In other words , each time a measure of this type is adopted , the Member States should enter into a commitment to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice .
Otherwise , we will be faced with the possibility of authoritarian or coercive methods being adopted without the possibility of recourse to the Court .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is a very delicate issue .
On the one hand , I believe that the Member States must shoulder their responsibilities and , in my view , their first responsibility is to agree in October , during the Portuguese Presidency , on the proposal that the Intergovernmental Conference has received from the European Council , a very clear mandate which includes the new powers of the Court of Justice .
There is no doubt that we shall then be able to take a huge step forward , particularly as regards the most delicate issues , the most sensitive sectors , i.e. those of the current third pillar , where the Court will finally have jurisdiction .
We will finally have the possibility of a full review by the Court of Justice .
I would point out that in some cases the Member States are reluctant even to follow the Court 's directions ; the Court of Justice has told us that in some areas the instrument of criminal law may also be a European instrument ; the Court said this of pollution , for instance , which is a sensitive issue .
Some Member States are continuing to oppose any such agreement , which unfortunately has to be unanimous and which simply follows on from a Court decision ; they nevertheless continue to oppose it .
Clearly , this problem can be resolved only if the Portuguese Presidency manages to obtain agreement in October , something that would be a major success and would bring about that leap forward that you have mentioned and that I fully support .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , it is an open secret that in some of the new EU Member States the forces behind organised crime are on the best possible terms with the highest political circles .
To what extent and by what means will the Union help those eastern and south-eastern European countries , which have huge monetary and financial problems themselves , to fight that interaction between politics and organised crime ?
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as a general objective this does not , in my view , relate only to the eastern countries , since the general objective is to encourage a strong , hard-line and ongoing fight against corruption .
The fight against corruption cannot come to an end , for instance , when a country becomes a Member of the European Union .
We have worked with many candidate countries which have become Member States of the European Union .
Those countries have achieved very good results and our interest now is , for instance , in working with those which are not candidates , but are simply our neighbours : the countries of the Western Balkans , important partners such as Ukraine , countries with which we have an important partnership .
I think that it is always in our interest to help those countries to root out corruption and business and politics are always bound up in corruption .
My answer to the question is certainly yes .
The European Union is interested , and I think that it is in our interest , and I would also say in the interest of the people of those countries , because people who suffer politics-related corruption have their rights denied on a daily basis .
That is something we owe to Europe and to the people of those countries .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , organising illegal immigration and people trafficking are important branches of the business of organised crime .
We as a European Union brought Frontex into being with your initiative - a good idea fraught with major implementing problems : Member States do not deliver , actions are interrupted in July and only resume in September .
What will you do to make the Frontex instrument function efficiently and provide Member States with the necessary support throughout the year , so that we can have an effective instrument in our hands to combat organised illegal immigration , something you also want to see ?
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in my view we have already achieved very substantial results .
Later this week , the second Frontex mission , to be called Nautilus II , will set off for the central Mediterranean ; I have also proposed a third Frontex mission in the western Mediterranean between the Balearic Islands , Spain , Morocco and Sardinia .
These are operations which require greater cooperation in terms of crew , vessels , helicopters and aircraft .
Cooperation between the Member States is growing every day because they are seeing the results .
Frontex personnel numbers need , however , to be increased because as you probably already know Frontex is currently working with fewer than 90 actual people in order to coordinate operations in the whole area of the external borders .
Bearing in mind the initial results , there is no doubt that this demonstrates record efficiency .
We are relying on the support of this Parliament so that Frontex can be helped from a financial point of view and from the point of view of the professional skills which it already possesses , but obviously not yet to the necessary extent .
Subject : Role of EU research in relation to European food policy
Given the conflicting views in the EU with regard to genetically modified ( GM ) foods , could the Commission outline its view in relation to the role that research has to play in this particular area .
Could the Commission state whether , from a scientific point of view , it is possible for any EU Member State to declare itself a ' GM-free zone ' ?
If so , would such a designation be consistent with the relevant EU legislation in this area and how would it be possible to authenticate such a designation in relation to livestock products ?
Does the Commission 's research suggest that it would be beneficial for the EU to adopt ' GM-free ' status , and if so what would be the potential consequences ?
Member of the Commission . - I should like to thank the honourable Member , Mrs McGuinness , for the question .
Firstly , I wish to reply to your question on GMO research in general .
In the past the Commission funded research projects on genetically modified food in the Fifth Framework Programme and also in the Sixth Framework Programme , with several projects that contribute to shedding light on the safety assessments of genetically modified foods .
Research projects were also funded on the issue of coexistence between GMO and conventional crops , which also addressed traceability measures .
These projects will ultimately contribute to reducing costs and to ensuring informed customer choices in line with Community legislation .
This year , in the first call for proposals in the 7th Framework Programme , the Commission called for the submission of proposals on a topic for research on assessment of short- and long-term effects of GMOs on human and animal health , with the aim of supporting the development of improving techniques for post-market monitoring and for analysing their possible limitations .
While evaluations have been finished , the selection process of proposals for funding is still going on .
Moreover , a complementary study has been launched by the Commission in DG Environment dealing with the long-term effects of genetically modified crops on health , biodiversity and the environment .
The key objective of this study will be to prioritise the potential risks of the main crop trade combinations cultivated worldwide by collecting and analysing information from peer-reviewed literature and from the relevant organisations , both within and outside the European Union .
With the necessary expertise in research and cultivation of GM crops , the results are expected next spring .
In the future , Commission-funded research could include tools for safety assessment , risk / benefit assessments , including risk communication and perception , detection methods , ways to ensure traceability and coexistence of genetically modified and conventional organisms .
On the second part of your question on the coexistence issue , I would like to add the following .
It should be noted that authorised GMOs can be freely traded and used within the EU under the conditions of the authorisation consent provided .
The legislative framework for the authorisation of GMOs for placing on the market and for deliberate release into the environment in the EU does not provide the possibility to establish zones where the cultivation or placing on the market of GMOs is generally prohibited .
A general ban would contradict Community legislation , in particular Directive 2001 / 18 / EC on the deliberate release into the environment of GMOs .
Indeed , only GMOs that have been scientifically evaluated as safe for the environment and animal and human health are authorised to be placed on the market .
A specific ban on a product must be scientifically justified according to Article 23 of this directive , the so-called safeguard clause article .
Community research into coexistence is studying appropriate measures to segregate authorised GM crops from conventional and organic crops in a feasible and practical way .
The research results indicate that sufficient segregation is feasible for the major crops studied so far - maize and sugar beet .
However , with increasing commercial cultivation and genetically modified crops in the EU and imports of genetically modified food and feed , adventitious presence through gene flow and admixture becomes unavoidable .
To add something from the area of my colleagues , the Commission continues to assess the coexistent measures notified by Member States with respect to their compliance with Community legislation .
The Council asked the Commission to develop jointly with the Member States guidelines for crop-specific co-existence measures at technical level .
The Commission is currently setting up a European co-existence bureau which will conduct this technical work jointly with national experts and stakeholders .
The work is planned to start by the end of 2007 .
The first crop to be addressed will be maize .
As for the further steps towards harmonisation , the Commission intends to sum up the developments in the Member States regarding the development of the regulatory regimes and practical experience with GM-crop multi-cultivation in a report scheduled for the year 2008 .
This will be the basis for the decision about future steps to take on this issue .
Finally , concerning the last part of the question concerning potential consequences , as regards the GM-free status , I would like to add the following .
Farmers are free to decide amongst themselves not to cultivate GMO or to create , on a voluntary basis , zones where GM crops are not cultivated .
These zones can be established only under the voluntary and unanimous agreement of all farmers concerned in the respective locations , while allowing for the possibility for any farmer to withdraw and cultivate authorised GMOs if he or she so wishes .
The regions or farmers which wish not to cultivate GMOs or to adopt a GM-free status , can certainly benefit from the research findings from the research framework programmes .
To date , the results from our research projects do not indicate any reasons why a GM-free status would be beneficial for public health or for the environment .
As regards other issues related to your questions , as for the economic implications on voluntary refraining from GM-crops cultivation , they depend on numerous factors such as prices for GM or non-GM crops , agronomic differences between GM and non-GM crops , differences in yield , seed costs and so on .
Local factors , pest pressure , climatic conditions , structure of agriculture of production and so on and regulatory conditions to ensure the coexistence of GM crops with conventional and organic production .
The economic impact is likely to vary between regions and Member States .
Such differences are also reflected in the differences between the uptake rates of GM crop cultivation in different European regions .
The EU livestock production is highly dependent on the import of animal feed derived from soya beans , maize and other crops .
Most of the imports of maize and soya bean-derived foodstuffs are labelled as GM .
Certified non-GM soya bean meal is currently only available for a small market segment .
Given the increasing share of GM soya bean production worldwide this could be expanded , but of course at higher cost .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I am grateful for your response , but it was rather lengthy , and I think I must comment on that - it was nearly nine minutes .
Madam President , I will be brief .
While you are chastising the Commissioner , may I say thank you because very often we do not get information and I really appreciate your clarity .
I will need to study the detail .
I have two comments and a question and I will watch the time .
Should a country decide voluntarily to be GM-free ?
This is being proposed in Ireland ; it is part of the Programme for Government and is being looked into .
Could we as a country decide we do not want to bring in food produced from , for example , meat of animals which have eaten GM products , or to bring any particular food into our country because we want to keep ourselves GM-free ?
Are you concerned about the impact on grain prices of such a policy ?
Member of the Commission . - I will tell you frankly that it is a bit difficult for me to answer .
Of course , they will have to follow the existing Community legislation .
That would be the straightforward answer .
If the question was connected to research and development , it would be easier for me , but I think the answer is quite straightforward : it has to be in line with the existing Community legislation .
Is it not the case that the Commission 's dilatory approach to approving GM derivatives is helping to inflate EU livestock feed prices ?
For example , the excessive delay in approving use of the corn by-product Hercules is severely damaging the competitiveness of our grain trade sector , yet GA 21 , a GM product from Argentina , is approved in the EU for human consumption , but not for animal feed .
Is it not time to rationalise and bring some sense to this situation and cut adrift some of the contrived political correctness that is driving it ?
Member of the Commission . - I would just like to stress that , from my point of view , we clearly take great care to take all possible steps to understand the GM or non-GM situation as much as possible .
Decisions made in the Commission are always based on existing knowledge .
We never ignore this and try to stick to this approach .
Policy implications , as you mentioned , have never been the subject of our attention .
I too would like to join Mrs McGuinness in thanking the Commissioner for an excellent and interesting response .
I think it will be a very useful precedential document for us to study , because it seems to me that he robustly supports the scientific justification for the use of GM crops in Europe where they are scientifically approved and authorised .
He mentioned the safeguard clause .
When is the Commission going to base all its decisions on the scientific research that his department is executing and to counter the public opinion that militates against the use of GMs , that is disadvantageous for our farming community and indeed for the cost of food , and is negative for the economy of Europe ?
Member of the Commission . - As you know , it is a complex issue and it is important to understand that some people have precautionary fears .
That is why it is important that we develop the awareness and the level of knowledge as far as possible , because it is of vital importance that we base our decisions on the knowledge we have .
I will try to do my best to ensure that this level of knowledge is developed in the future as far as possible .
Thank you Commissioner .
I did not mean to be too harsh but we have to strike a balance between detail and time , which is difficult .
Part two
Subject : The operation of the EU budget
Can the European Commission make a statement as to how it believes that procedures for agreeing how the EU budget is spent annually can be simplified and streamlined in future ?
Member of the Commission . - I would like to respond and to repeat my response which I already sent to Mr Crowley about the annual procedures and budget procedures in general , and how they can and could be improved .
I would like to give my answer in two parts .
The first for the current reading , what can still be done , how we can use funds more efficiently , and , of course , the future proposals in our revised treaty , which arose from the June Council this year .
In the current Treaty procedures , we can say that we are satisfied in general with the results , because under the current Treaty we have the possibility of improving and finding the fast-track solution if an urgent situation occurs .
A recent example is last year 's tsunami , and this year it was Palestine and partly Kosovo .
We were able to find the solution by fast-tracking one reading - but it takes some time , and very much depends on consolidated , trilateral negotiations between the two budgetary authorities and the Commission .
But of course the honourable Member is right in saying that , in this Treaty , there can already be a lot of room for improvement , and one of the examples concerns the pragmatic timetable in the annual budgetary procedure - followed since 1975 .
We , on top of the treaty request , we altogether - I mean all budgetary authorities and the Commission - agreed to add two and a half months to the procedure , mainly because at that time there was no electronic mail .
Now we do not need this time schedule but still , inertly , we have this time schedule on our tables and nobody tries to deal with this question .
Of course these productivity gains can be drawn already on this example .
But another element which is very interesting and we have adopted together in negotiations with Parliament and Council , and the Council has finally adopted , the new Financial Regulation and its implementing rules , which have been in force since May of this year , 2007 .
Here , already , we have some simplification and streamlining in the implementation of the European budget on an annual basis .
But of course probably the best messages I can transfer today to you are the revised treaty proposals .
And , here , I would like to point out four elements which can improve democratic scrutiny , accountability and transparency in the budgetary procedure .
The first innovative proposal in the revised treaty is that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure is proposed to be eliminated , providing one procedure for the adoption of the annual budget by the budgetary authorities .
Secondly , the so-called ' maximum rate of increase ' in Article 27 of the EC Treaty - usually a source of conflict in the annual negotiation process - will no longer be in use or necessary because the substitute in practical terms for the maximum rate of increase , the multi-annual financial framework , will be enshrined in the treaties , which is not the case today .
Finally , in future financial regulations we will have a different adoption process .
This will be adopted by codecision with Parliament .
Until 2007 it was decided unanimously only by the Council - by the Member States .
That is a huge difference which we envisage .
So all these proposals , together with the possibility of improving on an annual and everyday basis , will give more powers to the democratically elected European Parliament and will further democratise the decision-making process .
I thank the Commissioner for her response and for her facilitation of a further question .
It concerns the question of what the new Reform Treaty presents to us with regard to the multiannual funding aspect and the functioning of the budget .
As you know , every year we have the usual arguments with regard to certain own resources that are being made available as well as what other funds we have made available and how those monies have been distributed to the different headings , whether it is agriculture , social structure , structural funding , regional funding and so on .
One of the biggest complaints we always get here in Parliament is that people do not know where European money is being spent .
They do not know where exactly the funding they are giving , as they see it , is being distributed amongst the different countries .
I know Member States have a responsibility themselves to say that , but is there some mechanism whereby the Commission could be more forthcoming with regard to highlighting the areas of expenditure ?
Member of the Commission . - I would like to announce that we obtained an agreement with the Council precisely on the new Financial Regulation , under our transparency initiative , whereby Member States have agreed to report and make public all information on all recipients of funds - not only for agriculture but for all funds .
The agriculture agreement will take effect from 2009 and the others from 2008 , 2009 and 2010 .
This is a huge step for transparency , responsibility , openness and communication with citizens .
Citizens will be able to know who will receive each penny and why , so it will also be much easier for Member States to answer .
( DE ) Commissioner , my question concerns the late payment directive .
Many small and medium-sized undertakings , and many researchers too , constantly complain about the length of time it takes from authorisation of a project to actual payment .
Pre-financing is far too difficult for many small and medium-sized undertakings .
Do you think the European Commission might also bring its payment conditions into line with the late payment directive , which applies throughout Europe and which we all agreed ?
Member of the Commission . - We know the problem and have applied new regulations and implementing rules to these questions .
We hope that the new ones , which have been in place and in force since May of this year , will simplify the procedure and , of course , will allow for a more responsible response from the Commission also .
We understand that the rules need to be the same for everybody , not only for Member States and recipients but for the Commission also .
( DE ) Commissioner , you referred to political crises .
This year we have seen countless natural disasters in Greece , the UK and elsewhere .
It is most important for budget funds to be made available rapidly in such cases .
Are the instruments we have now adequate or could improvements perhaps be made ?
Might there be ways of increasing the overall financial volume , given that the figures for this summer show that the funds we have at present will certainly not suffice ?
Member of the Commission . - Concerning Greece in particular , we are looking for at least three sources of possible accumulation of funds .
From the regional policy funds , we have a special fund of over EUR 1 billion annually which we can use .
We are also looking into some re-programming - redirection of programmes which had been previously planned , and the Greek Government next week will negotiate with our technical people on what programmes they want to change or replace by others and where to prioritise .
Also , agricultural funds can be used for restoring the land , especially land which was used as agricultural land on this peninsula .
So we are able to look into three or four possible sources and to accumulate them .
But on the procedural side , referring to the question of the main questioner , sometimes procedures take a lot of time , if we are being open with ourselves and do not fear saying that .
Of course , we will receive a final concrete request from the Greek Government approximately 10 days after all calculations , but the response and procedures will take a lot of time .
Usually , we pay , on average , between six and eight months after the event and that , of course , is not the best solution for the Member States and for the situation to be resolved .
While the procedures which we have today in the Treaty make it possible for us to be faster , the political will of all the budgetary authorities needs to be in place .
Plus , of course , the proposed new treaty can make this faster .
But , in general , on the amounts - that is an absolutely different question .
We are all the time being asked to use the budget more flexibly .
For example , we have some lines of new spending and some reserves which , by the end of the year , will have been returned .
This flexibility is not yet given , by the Council or by Parliament .
I would be happy to have this flexibility , and I am sure my fellow Commissioners would be happy to have it because , yes , sometimes this rigidity of the budget leaves us with our hands tied .
So there are a few sources : flexibility , general amounts and speed and rapid response from all budgetary procedures .
These are the three sources where I see we can gain more efficiency in the final result .
Subject : Planning of subject disciplines and areas of learning under the ' Education and Training 2010 ' programme
How will European citizens be persuaded of the value of continuing to teach and learn subjects which have no strictly practical application , in particular classical languages and literature , and historical studies ?
Member of the Commission . - As we are all aware , under Article 149 of the EC Treaty , the content of the education programme is the responsibility of Member States , which means that decisions on the design of the curricula delivered by the educational institutions , as well as the subjects taught , are therefore taken solely by the Member States .
The Commission has the role of supporting the Member States in their development of quality education .
Under our Education and Training 2010 work programme , the Commission plays a central role in facilitating the exchange of best practice between Member States in order to help ensure that their education and training systems can meet the challenges of the 21st century .
Because labour market issues are an important part of the Lisbon Strategy , it is clear that aspects of education policy that relate to labour market , and more generally to competitiveness , play an important role in this respect .
This said , it does not follow that subjects such as ancient Greek , Latin , history , archaeology and linguistics are unrelated to the labour market .
Apart from direct employment opportunities in many of these areas , the study of such subjects entails the development and transmission of a range of generic skills , such as analysis and reasoning .
One of the reference texts for the work programme in the recommendation of Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2006 on key competences for lifelong learning , these competences include ' communication in foreign languages and cultural awareness and expression ' .
The latter includes an awareness of local , national and European cultural heritage and their place in the world .
Civic competence as defined in the resolution includes knowledge of contemporary events , as well as the main events in transnational , European and world history .
So I think this is a very direct and explicit contribution to the orientation which is asked for and supported by Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou , and , I believe , by many other Members of this Parliament .
( EL ) Commissioner , thank you for your answer .
You have assured me of your continued interest .
How much of the funding is being allocated for the promotion of the ' Education and Training 2010 ' programme , however ?
You are the Commissioner responsible for Culture .
What part of the research from the 7th programme is to be used in the areas you have mentioned - that is , in furthering knowledge in the fields of language , culture , history and linguistics ?
Member of the Commission . - There is no specific subdivision now , but as you know from the legal base we have the programme is divided into four main pillars concerning lifelong learning : Erasmus , Comenius , Leonardo da Vinci and Grundtvig , plus horizontal actions or transfer selections .
One could more or less say the same about research and development and cooperation , but it is very important that partners - institutions - engage themselves in areas which are close to humanities , to cultural awareness , to nurturing of values .
So , in a concrete sense , for example , we support , in the lifelong learning programme , the European Standing Conference of History Teachers ' Association , and it is important that such an association exists , that it complies with the rules , that it is eligible , and then we can provide support .
I will not encourage divergence or too much separation of the soft sciences and hard sciences .
Civic education comprises basic competences plus the very horizontal natures of skills , knowledge and attitudes that are needed not only for the labour market , but also for living together in a more and more diverse Community and at local , regional or European level .
Subject : Education drop-out rates
According to the official statistics published by Eurostat for 2006 , the education drop-out rate among young Europeans aged between 18 and 24 is 15,3 % .
In 14 Member States , however , that indicator exceeds the European average .
The highest education drop-out rates are in Malta ( 41 % ) , Portugal ( 39,2 % ) , Spain ( 29,9 % ) , Iceland ( 26,3 % ) , Italy ( 20,8 % ) , Latvia ( 19 % ) and Romania ( 19 % ) .
The European Union has proposed to raise the employment rate to 70 % by 2020 through the Lisbon Strategy .
Against the backdrop of the increase in labour productivity , however , the workforce requires ever more training .
What measures does the European Commission envisage taking to reduce the education drop-out rate ?
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , in 2000 , the millennium year , 17.6 % of the population aged between 18 and 24 had not gone beyond lower secondary education .
By last year , 2006 , the level had fallen to 15.3 % .
Six new Member States had already beaten our 2010 benchmark , which is 10 % .
Under Article 149 , as I previously mentioned , this is the full responsibility of Member States .
The content and organisation of education is the competence of Member States .
Our role is to support and supplement the action of Member States .
We have done this in a number of ways .
I will mention just some .
In particular , the Commission has supported the development of the evidence base on which policy measures can be built , sponsoring a number of studies around this problem .
Further , last year , in our 2006 communication on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems , the Commission stressed the importance of pre-primary , pre-school , education as an effective means to reduce school drop-out rates , and pointed to the dangers of tracking pupils too early .
The Commission has also launched a public consultation process quite recently on the modernisation of school education .
This includes seeking the views of stakeholders on how best to tackle early school-leaving .
In the framework of the analysis of the Lisbon national reforms programme , the Commission issued specific recommendations to Member States about early school-leaving , where it was deemed necessary .
Through the education training 2010 work programme , it has used the open method of coordination to develop good practice and peer learning on early school-leaving .
Member States have also been encouraged to make use of the Structural Funds for targeted interventions to tackle particularly high rates of early school-leaving and to participate in projects funded under the lifelong learning programme , which addresses this issue .
In conclusion , progress has been visible and measurable , but not yet enough , and we need to really continue and improve the dynamics .
( RO ) Madam President , Commissioner , thank you for your answer .
Even if education is the Member States ' responsibility , the Commission should involve itself in ensuring the future of the European Union .
Recommendations are part of soft law .
The European Commission has to explicitly request the Member States to develop action plans for fighting against school drop out .
The European Union needs skilled human resources .
It is unacceptable that young people originating from poor families or from a rural environment are obliged to leave school because of their financial situation .
The EU population is growing old and in order to ensure the sustainability of the social welfare schemes increasing work productivity is necessary .
Here is my question : Commissioner , what are the measures you are taking in order to support Member States to financially assist those children who deserve to continue their studies , especially those originating from poor families or from a rural environment ?
This is really a problem and we are talking about the future of Europe .
Member of the Commission . - This could be a long answer but , in short , we try to cooperate , pool resources and policies in order to promote better conditions for young people .
Tomorrow , for example , the Commission is going to adopt a written procedure - a policy paper on youth employment .
We believe that youth is our future and the future starts now .
We encourage especially the new Member States to use more structural funds for the support of educational policies for mobility .
Of course , in saying that Member States ' basic responsibility is the system and the content , we believe that quality or efficiency and equity followed by Member States could deliver more concrete and better answers for our citizens , including the young .
I am sure the investment in human resources , especially via education and training , is the most valuable and efficient investment in society 's cohesion and future competitiveness .
I say that not only as the Commissioner responsible for these areas , but also as a politician and a father .
So we do not doubt that we need to do more together .
You referred to the Structural Funds several times .
What can you , as Commissioner , do to encourage countries to use those funds for their people , for social programmes etc . ?
Certainly , in Ireland , I know that the bulk of those funds were used for roads and for big infrastructure projects .
Virtually nothing was spent on people .
Member of the Commission . - We are free people , free societies , and it is an invitation to be reasonable in this freedom .
I said that investment into human potential is the best .
I am not against investing in modern infrastructure , in transport and in the environment , which is important .
But even in the communication I mentioned in my introductory answer , we say - and this is based on scientific evidence - that investment in pre-school attainment of children from a poor socioeconomic background is the most efficient way of dealing with their worsened conditions for cohesion .
The rate of return into education at pre-school age , for example , is higher than the rate of return from investing the same amounts in the longer term in financial institutions .
So , that said , this is an invitation for ministers and Members to behave like reasonable fathers and mothers and to think about future generations , not just about tomorrow , the immediate future or polls in the next elections .
I think that this kind of generational , long-term approach is highly needed and very efficient even in financial terms , but sometimes we just behave according to short-term , even narrow-minded approaches .
Europe is full of examples ; it is a mosaic , and some Member States show examples that are now a world reference .
Look at the PISA study , and I invite you to look at the next study , which will be published by the OECD in September .
We will see where we are after three years and some European countries are amongst the best performers in the world .
We need such performers , and we need more of them .
Subject : EIT
As the Community institutions move to set up the European Institute of Technology they have been negotiating about the funding for the project .
The intention is to obtain money from the private sector as well .
How can the Commission ensure that the EIT does not suffer the same fate as the Galileo programme , to which the private sector has made no financial contribution ?
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , this is the question on EIT private sector funding .
We believe that public and private partnerships are instrumental in driving information in the knowledge-based economy .
If not , we do not succeed .
The private sector provides not only additional financial resources but , more importantly , can bring about changes in the strategic direction of innovation .
So I would say it is not so much about money itself , but the way we cooperate , how we put together partners and interests .
Many EU countries have taken action to facilitate structural relations between the public and private sector with a view to promoting knowledge transfers between universities and industry .
In this context , the activities of the EIT and , notably , knowledge and innovation communities will be implemented through innovative public-private structure partnerships and financed through a variety of public-private sources .
The precise arrangements for their funding cannot be determined in advance and will clearly evolve over time , but the objective is to maximise the share of contributions from the private sector .
The Community contribution , which was agreed at EUR 308 million for the next Financial Perspective , is intended to act as a catalyst to draw forth resources from the private sector .
The Commission has been particularly attentive in seeking to facilitate and attract private sector participation in the financing of the EIT and knowledge innovation communities ( KICs ) .
For example , a key criterion for the selection of the KICs will be their capacity to ensure long-term and sustainable financing , including a substantial contribution from the private sector .
It will be important for the governing board to identify fields for potential KICs that will attract the interest of a wide range of participants , including those in the private sector .
Moreover , the EIT will be empowered to establish an EIT foundation with the specific objective of mobilising and leveraging resources from both individual and corporate donors .
( FI ) Madam President , Commissioner , it has been said that private funding would also come from the United States of America and Microsoft has been mentioned as an EIT sponsor .
Is it not alarming that such large companies from the United States will try and benefit from the results of research produced at the European Institute of Technology ?
At the same time I would like to ask this : will these private sponsors possibly also be imposing conditions on the funding they provide ?
Commissioner , do I detect from your answer to Mr Seppänen just now that you actually have indications of major interest from companies wishing to invest in the EIT ?
Because , if not , if you do not achieve substantial or sufficient funds from the private sector , will you refrain from attacking the EU budget and will you take it as a lesson that perhaps there is not that much interest in funding the EIT ?
But I would like your assurance that perhaps you have these sincere expressions of interest .
Member of the Commission . - We had and we have an increasing interest , especially now we have reached the current stage of the proposal itself , because at the beginning this was more of an idea or a concept and now it is a concrete text .
It has not yet been finalised formally - we hope to do that by the end of this year - but the messages from individual businesses or business organisations have been more and more concrete and positive , in the sense of possibly deeper involvement in the future .
We had talks with the European Round Table of Industrialists , Business Europe , Eurochambers and many other associations , like the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations ( EARTO ) .
I really can say that the messages were more and more concrete .
Of course , nobody writes a blank cheque or makes commitments in advance , and what we do should not replace what is going on in a positive sense in some centres or in partnerships , but the EIT should create still further momentum , incentives and scope for a more innovation-friendly Europe Union .
That is the intention and this is a shared responsibility .
( LT ) The idea of the European Institute of Technology is to generate innovations which would contribute to the enhancement of the competitiveness of the European Union .
If large private companies were to participate in the activities of the Institute , would innovations be accessible to other market participants ?
What about the Member States ?
Should the Member States and the European Community not be the main financing bodies of a European institution ?
Member of the Commission . - We have to define the role of the EIT itself , which is the institution for running the competition selection , the evaluation monitoring and organising the framework for a whole range of knowledge and innovation communities .
However , regarding innovation , the core partnership is at the level of KICs .
There , one can imagine considerable cooperation with SMEs , and the internal arrangement is not only their right but also works to their advantage because they must build trust to increase or to start new cooperation under the umbrella of the EIT and for the basic relations around the intellectual property , the proposal refers to the principles of the Seventh Framework Programme .
I am sure that there must be enough freedom and flexibility to arrange intellectual property rights between partners for the benefit of their cooperation and of the relation between KICs , vis-à-vis or with the EIT , and also for the benefit of course of further application of innovation .
We have many models in Europe .
I think we can use a lot of inspiration for real encouragement and actually EIT could be a kind of an icebreaker to open better conditions for a knowledge-friendly Europe , including intellectual property friendliness or Community patents or policies which are very much needed and important for a real transfer of knowledge between partners .
Questions 38 and 39 will receive written answers .
Subject : Absolute prohibition of conversion of fixed-term contracts into contracts of indefinite duration in Greek public sector
It is six years since Directive 1999 / 70 / EC entered into force in 2001 and Greece has not yet complied therewith .
Despite final judgments in favour of workers on fixed-term contracts , the Greek Supreme Court has ruled , with reference to the Greek Constitution and setting aside previous case-law , that it is absolutely prohibited to convert fixed-term employment contracts into contracts of indefinite duration in the Greek public sector .
What are the Commission 's views on the evident refusal of Greece to implement Directive 1999 / 70 / EC ?
Will it initiate proceedings against Greece before the Court of Justice ?
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Council Directive 1999 / 70 / EC concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work requires the Member States to adopt such measures that would prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts .
However , the Member States are not obliged to replace fixed-term contracts with open-ended contracts assuming that there are other effective measures in place that would prevent or sanction such abuse .
The European Court of Justice confirmed this interpretation in its judgment of 4 July 2006 in Case C-212 / 04 ( Adeneler ) pertaining to Greek legislation .
The European Court of Justice also stated that interpretation of the relevant national legislation does not fall within its competence .
It is entirely for the Greek courts to provide an interpretation of relevant Greek legislation and to determine whether this legislation complies with the requirements of the Directive regarding the existence of effective measures that would prevent and sanction abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts .
Greece implemented the above-mentioned Directive through Presidential Decree No 164 / 2004 concerning the public sector .
The Commission carried out a thorough analysis of this Decree and concluded that it was compatible with the requirements of the Directive .
Since the Directive was implemented at a late stage , on 19 July 2004 , the Presidential Decree contained an exceptional temporary provision that makes it possible under certain conditions to change successive fixed-term employment contracts concluded before the date on which the Decree entered into force into employment contracts of indefinite duration .
I am aware that the legal situation concerning the abuse of fixed-term employment contracts in the Greek public sector was a subject of disputes over the last few years .
This was confirmed by the recent judgment of the Greek Supreme Court of 11 June 2007 in which the court annulled its previous case-law .
As already mentioned , according to the judgment of the European Court of Justice , the national courts are responsible for interpreting and applying the relevant Greek legislation , including the Constitution , in relation to the circumstances of particular cases submitted to them .
However , in doing so the courts must duly observe the applicable EU legislation , in particular Directive 1999 / 70 / EC .
The Commission is closely monitoring the development of the situation in Greece .
It will carefully examine the latest ruling of the Supreme Court and will monitor subsequent measures adopted by the Greek authorities .
To conclude I would like to mention that according to the information supplied by the Commission , several Greek courts have already submitted preliminary questions concerning this matter to the European Court of Justice .
The European Court of Justice will thus get the opportunity to deliver an opinion on the interpretation of the relevant Community legislation .
( EL ) Commissioner , you are well aware that Greece is the only country that has still failed to implement a directive that has been in force for six years .
Tens of thousands of contractors are cursed with a government that you say ought to respect the decisions of the courts but nonetheless passes laws whereby it refuses to respect the final decisions of the courts and the case-law of the European Court .
Many of those who died in Greece 's fires this year in were contracted forest fire-fighters with more than 10 years ' service , employed on a temporary basis , and with deficient training .
For months now you have claimed to be studying this question .
As guardians of European legislation , do you intend to do something ?
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Of course the European Commission is a guardian of the European Treaties and European law , and of course for this reason we are prepared to take all the necessary steps .
The Commission has identified many problems regarding the first Presidential Decree , including those that were considered in the Adeneler case .
Because of these problems the Commission contacted the Greek authorities in 2004 .
I can therefore confirm that we are attentive to this issue .
We examine very carefully the most recent judgments of the Greek Supreme Court and if we find out that action has to be taken by the Commission , we will not hesitate to do so .
Of course many questions arise about the abuse of the fixed-term employment contracts concluded before the date of adoption of the Directive , including those that were already in force on 10 July 2002 , the day on which the Directive was to be implemented , unless a temporary provision applied to these contracts .
Essentially I want to say that we are pay adequate attention to this issue and that we will take such steps as are necessary to protect the Treaties .
Subject : Equal opportunities
Is the Commission satisfied , in European Year of Equal Opportunities , that real progress is being made in ' new ' as well as ' old ' Member States towards equality of people of different ethnicity and sexual orientation ?
What specific initiatives is the Commission taking in the light of continued homophobic actions in certain EU as well as non-EU European states , such as the ban of a gay pride march in Vilnius and the attempted break-up of an equalities demonstration in Romania ?
What steps is the Commission taking to ensure that EU institutions and states live up to their commitments on racial non-discrimination and protection of minorities , especially as regards Roma people , in the face of some disturbing electoral success for extremist and intolerant parties ?
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , 10 years after the inclusion of Article 13 in the EC Treaty we have made important progress in making sure that all citizens of the European Union are protected from discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin or sexual orientation , among other things .
However , this protection is not yet complete , nor have we yet the real ' equality ' mentioned by the honourable Member .
All the Member States must abide by the so-called Racial Equality Directive and Employment Equality Directive and it is the task of the European Union to monitor the correct transposition of both Directives into national legislation and their effective application .
Consequently , on 27 June 2007 the Commission issued Reasoned Opinions to 14 Member States that have not transposed Directive 2000 / 43 / EC correctly .
I want to state that the factual grounds that gave rise to these reasoned opinions vary of course from country to country as does their gravity .
In any event , 14 states have received these reasoned opinions .
2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and it has given the public authorities and civil society an incentive to organise actions and campaigns focusing on the benefits of diversity and non-discrimination .
The fight against discrimination must constantly be at the forefront of our mind .
In 2008 the Commission will submit proposals for the European Year of Equal Opportunities follow-up programmes : these may contain measures for finalising the framework of anti-discrimination legislation .
An on-line consultation that was launched in July and will last until mid-October forms part of preparations for assessing the corresponding impact .
I would also like to state that the Commission rejects all forms of homophobia and promotes a society based on tolerance and respect .
It welcomed the European Parliament resolution of 26 April 2007 on homophobia in Europe .
In this context the Commission regrets that local authorities did not grant the necessary permissions for the truck promoting diversity in Europe to visit Vilnius on 25 May as had been planned , and banned the accompanying gay parade .
The Commission also regrets that the participants in the march for diversity during the Romanian GayFest 2007 festival on 11 June ( which received moral support and used the European Year logo ) were intimidated by extremist groups and needed police protection .
The Racial Equality Directive I mentioned earlier prevents discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin .
I would like to stress that this applies in full to the Roma as well .
Furthermore , the Commission is of the opinion that in order to be applied properly , the EU legislation must be complemented by information campaigns that would inform the Roma of their rights , and by events that will inform the general public about the rights and duties resulting from the anti-discrimination law .
In 2007 , the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All , events focusing on the Roma are taking place in Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Greece , Spain , France , Ireland , Italy , Lithuania , Poland , Romania , Finland and Slovakia .
Actions aimed at combating discrimination against the Roma are also financed under the auspices of the European Social Fund and PROGRESS 2007-2013 , a programme for employment and social solidarity , which supports capacity-building among the Roma .
Although it is regrettable that 14 Member States have had to have reasoned opinions , I am , at least , delighted that the Commission is taking forceful infringement proceedings , because at the moment we have had a complete gap between the letter of the legislation and what is actually happening .
Commissioner Špidla has mentioned some of the problems relating to the Equality truck denied access to Vilnius .
Apparently , half of Lithuanian MPs think that homosexuality is a perversion .
You have real problems in the public and governmental sector .
Last week , the Fundamental Rights Agency said that many Member States were failing to properly enforce race discrimination legislation , so I hope that toughness goes on because we really need it .
Will you take account in the infringement proceedings of the various pronouncements and the tolerance of extremism by ministers and public officials ?
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) I do not think that the speech by the honourable Member contained any questions but I would like to endorse the opinion she expressed in any case .
Both of the Directives on non-discrimination are fundamental European laws .
We must ensure that they are fully transposed and we must ensure that non-discrimination , equal opportunities and tolerance continue to be fundamental values that are actively implemented .
That is why the European Commission has initiated infringement proceedings against 14 Member States .
However , I also want to say that in general the individual Member States accept these high values and that the majority of problems we have been debating , problems that necessitate the initiation of infringement proceedings , are of a legislative and therefore a technical / administrative nature .
They do not represent a trend of a Member State rejecting the Treaties .
We now have a series of five questions relating to persons with disabilities .
I understand that the questioners were possibly expecting a block answer .
I would not want to deprive anyone of an individual answer , but if you wish to deal with the questions together , Commissioner , I would be happy for you to do so .
First , however , I should like to take some guidance from one of the questioners before we proceed .
I too would be happy if the Commissioner would answer all the questions together , if that were possible .
But , if not , perhaps you might allow him to read the answers to all five , if he has separate answers , and we will take all of the supplementaries at the end of the five replies .
I am happy to do that .
I am happy to do whatever the Commissioner feels comfortable with to make sure that Members all get an answer to what they have asked , but I am also clear that the questions are linked and that we would otherwise risk going around in circles .
But I am happy with whatever the Commissioner feels he can best deliver to us .
Subject : Backing independent living with action
Will the European Commission join me in welcoming people with severe and multiple disabilities who form part of the European Network for Independent Living ( ENIL ) to Strasbourg this week ?
In response to Parliament 's resolution ( P6 _ TA ( 2006 ) 0527 ) on the Commission 's biennial report on disability , what progress has the Commission made in promoting the concept of ' independent living ' for disabled people , including the right to retain funding for ' personal assistance ' when moving between EU Member States for employment , education or residence ?
Will the Commission bring forward a Europe-wide policy on personal assistance ?
Subject : Promotion of independent living for persons with disabilities
De-institutionalisation and greater autonomy are among the priorities of the European Union Disability Strategy .
What progress has the Commission made to date as regards the recommendations of the study drawn up on the de-institutionalisation of persons with disabilities ?
Does it agree that an increasing number of persons with disabilities are being institutionalised ?
What further measures does it intend to take to tackle this challenge ?
Subject : Rights of people with a disability
Welcoming the Commission 's commitment to a ' human rights ' approach to disability since its 1996 Communication , and acknowledging the presence in Strasbourg of the European Network for Independent Living , does the Commission accept that the human rights of people with a disability are abused in the European Union as well as across the rest of the world ?
Which further steps does the Commission plan to take to address such abuses in the EU ?
Subject : Mainstreaming for disabled people
Welcoming the Commission 's support for the principle of mainstreaming for disabled people , on how many occasions has the Inter-Service Group organised by DG Employment and Social Affairs met during 2007 , and which Directorates-General of the Commission have not been present at these meetings ?
In connection with this week 's visit to Strasbourg by the European Network for Independent Living , and welcoming the Commission 's commitment to ' ring fence ' a fixed percentage of its overseas development assistance to health , education and social services , which steps is the Commission making to make sure community development projects for disabled people benefit from these funds ?
Subject : Representation of disabled people
Could the European Commission describe which arrangements are in place to guarantee representation of disabled people and organisations of disabled people in EU social inclusion strategies ?
In line with the principle endorsed by the Commission of ' nothing about us without us ' , what further steps does the Commission plan in this regard ?
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Since I am going to try to give a very brief reply to all of the questions together , I will concentrate only on the most important issues .
A program focusing on the active integration of disabled people has been developed since 2006 as part of the European Action Plan for people with disabilities .
At the heart of this program is the right of disabled people to independent living .
Since the Commission advocates de-institutionalisation and since the general opinion in this area is similar , the Commission is also examining alternatives to care provided in sheltered institutions .
The Commission supports research into suitable methods for so-called de-institutionalisation .
Independent living for disabled people must be supported by the provision of quality community services to these people ; not only of a physical nature but also respect for human dignity .
Drawing on my own personal experience I can say that educating the people who provide these services to persons dependent on them is very important for the quality of the social services .
The way in which the basic rights of disabled people are observed and the quality of their lives depend to a large degree on education .
As I have already mentioned , the Commission is using its right to actively support the development of community services and I want to say that in this process the Commission always concentrates on the quality of life of individuals .
Indeed , de-institutionalisation itself does not automatically guarantee an improved quality of life and autonomy : they are only guaranteed when de-institutionalisation is replaced by community services of a corresponding quality and standard .
In this context , the Commission has requested a study on social integration , the purpose of which is to assess the situation of disabled people in large sheltered institutions where , as you know , there are many instances where the standards and way of life are not up to the standards and quality the people undoubtedly deserve .
We must therefore monitor this situation to ensure that it is improved .
However , the Commission cannot confirm the opinion that the number of people in sheltered institutions is on the increase .
We do not have the figures at our disposal but , as I have already said , de-institutionalisation is the principle we follow and we will continue to follow that path .
I would also like to stress that we welcome initiatives that concentrate on the basic principles of the quality of provision of social care at a European level .
I would stress , too , that the fact that the issue of the rights of disabled people has been elevated to an international level thanks to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is , in my opinion , a huge step forward .
The Commission encourages the Member States to ratify this Convention and to give a concrete response to it as quickly as possible .
The Commission has pledged to take account of the needs and rights of disabled persons and to include them in all relevant EU strategies .
The issue of providing for the needs of disabled people is dealt with , at EU level , by the Commission 's Inter-Service Group on Disability , as well as through cooperation with the Member States and parties concerned , including disabled persons , in the High Level Group on Disability in the European Union .
Since 2000 the European Community has co-financed approximately 160 projects for disabled persons in developing countries amounting to EUR 100 million .
These projects provide support for Eastern Europe , the Middle East and ACP countries and concentrate on people with mental and physical disabilities , capacity-building , community rehabilitation , the rights of disabled people , social inclusion , poverty reduction , de-institutionalisation , etc .
Ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt that the Commission implements active policies for disabled people and that we have achieved significant progress within the European Union .
However , as I said when answering a previous question , we still have a long way to go .
We have been working on the basic process of possible amendments to the existing European legislation .
This is what I was talking about when replying to the question about the Directives on non-discrimination .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have tried briefly to touch on the most important issues and due to the rather improvised nature of this debate I may well have neglected some issues while there are others that I might not have explained quite clearly .
Therefore , I would suggest - if this is acceptable - that I now listen to your supplementary questions and respond to them .
However , I will respond again in writing to the questions that I have now answered orally so that they receive the attention they deserve .
Madam President , I should like to thank the Commissioner for his flexibility .
A number of us who are active in the Disability Intergroup of Parliament have chosen to table these questions to mark the presence in Strasbourg of some 200 people with severe and multiple disabilities , who are living in institutions throughout Europe and are part of what is called the European Network on Independent Living .
I know they will be very proud that this Parliament is addressing their concerns and needs in this Question Time .
I wonder if the Commissioner could join me and if you , Madam President , could join me in welcoming their representatives to the Chamber .
I wonder if , Commissioner , you could confirm that the European Network on Independent Living , as a user-led organisation run for and by disabled people , represents a very important interest group for disabled people in Europe and that you would join me in hoping that they could benefit from the support for coordination of disability organisations Europe-wide currently benefiting organisations such as the European Blind Union and the European Union of the Deaf in the future .
Secondly and finally , Commissioner , you said some very good words , which I thank you for , about independent living and community care for disabled people .
The point in my question about a European strategy for personal assistance , enabling professional workers who are managed by and employed by disabled people to meet their care needs , is a very important objective of this freedom ride of the European Network on Independent Living , and I hope you will commit yourself to advancing their cause in this respect .
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , representatives of disabled groups : conducting a dialogue with those who should sit around the table , with those who have direct vested interests , is something at the very heart of practically all European strategies .
I cannot imagine us developing any strategy , any plan without such a dialogue .
This dialogue is comprehensive and valuable but I think that we should search for yet more effective methods and solutions .
The Commission intends to contribute to progress in this matter by coordinating the mutual exchange of opinions and other actions supporting the exchange of information .
It will also provide an emphatic reminder of the need to develop important paths for the preparation of new strategies , jointly approved by the Member States , to be submitted in the autumn of 2008 .
In other words , we have a lot of work to do together .
( EL ) Commissioner , contrary to the right of all European citizens , a significant number of disabled people are forced to live in institutions , regardless of their choice .
Since the active integration of the disabled into economic and social life depends on their ability to live independently , I should like to ask whether the European Commission intends to adopt legislative measures to guarantee this right .
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am of the opinion that the current European legislation is of a high quality compared with the rest of the world .
The adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is extremely important too .
It is also clear that de-institutionalisation forms a part of all European strategies in this field , including those that are funded by our financial instruments .
This transition is possible .
There are countries that have done away with institutional care completely , to the benefit of disabled persons - there may be only a few of them but they do exist - and these prove that this goal can be achieved .
On the other hand , it is a goal that has to be achieved gradually and in a very organic way because , as I have already said , de-institutionalisation that lacks corresponding safety provisions may conversely worsen the position of disabled people , as has been demonstrated in many countries around the world .
I am thinking in particular of cases of de-institutionalisation in the United States where this route , in the absence of corresponding safety provisions , has proved to be very controversial .
Madam President , it is true that progress has been made but it has to be said that progress is painfully slow .
Indeed , a lot of the progress would not have been made without the campaigning that has been undertaken by people with disabilities themselves .
What I want to ask you specifically , Commissioner , with regard to the study you mentioned on integration into society : does this study deal with the issue of independent living ?
Of course , it is extremely important that quality community services are put in place in order to ensure that people can be taken out of institutions .
However , these community care services need to be directed towards enabling people with disabilities to lead independent lives , which is a crucial demand for people with disabilities .
Linked to that , as a European Union , we need to look at how , for instance , the right to personal assistance could be made available to people wherever they move to within the European Union .
Could I ask if that aspect of independent living is being addressed by the study and , if not , would you undertake that a study of the availability of personal assistance and the generalisation of such a scheme across the European Union could be addressed , and indeed the portability of it ?
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , I think that have you touched on very serious issues that are generally linked to the issue of disability .
Firstly , I would like to say that unfortunately at present we do not have as yet at our disposal comparable data that provides a good basis for a reliable European strategy .
Acquiring data that can be interpreted as such is one of the Commission 's goals .
We also have to realise that the debate you started and the issue you mentioned are very closely connected to the debate on services , on generally beneficial social services .
Again , this is a related topic .
I would also like to stress that a Directive concerning air traffic and the mobility of workers or mobility of people within the European Union has been implemented , and that of course there are plans to extend these regulations to other types of transport , which is logical .
There is also the issue of the transferability and accessibility of social services or various social measures for disabled people .
This issue is dealt with within the framework of implementation of Regulation 1408 / 71 / EEC on the coordination of social security schemes and in the Directive on the portability of supplementary pension rights .
The aim of all of these tools is fundamentally to reinforce the values of , and opportunities for , an independent life , with a corresponding degree of safety , anywhere in the European Union .
I can be brief because many of my questions have been asked .
Some EU Member States will be proactive in acknowledging the rights of their citizens with disabilities .
Some , unfortunately , resist improvement of standards and even create or tolerate obstacles .
We have strategies and action plans , which are well and good , but only an enforceable disability directive has a chance of bringing errant states - like the one I live in - into line .
When can we expect this directive , Commissioner ?
Could you confirm that you will be giving written answers to the five questions ?
Member of the Commission . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , in my first reply dealing with the Directives on non-discrimination I mentioned a study drafted within the framework of a process for the assessment of implementation and effectiveness , which examines whether and how it would be suitable to amend the relevant European legislation .
One of the issues this study will certainly look into is the possibility of drafting a separate directive dealing with disabled people .
This issue is under discussion and we are using the appropriate European means to determine which method is the most effective for achieving the goal in question .
As I said in my previous remarks , of course I will reply to all questions in writing in case some questions were not answered sufficiently due to the nature of this slightly improvised session .
That is clear .
I will provide additional written answers to all the questions raised during this debate .
Thank you , Commissioner , and thank you for the manner in which we have been able to conduct these last questions .
I think that has been helpful and , I hope , satisfactory .
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers , apart from Question 58 , which has been withdrawn , and Question 73 , which is inadmissible ( see Annex ) .
That concludes Question Time .

Reducing alcohol-related harm ( debate )
The next item is the report by Alessandro Foglietta , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on a European Union strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm .
rapporteur . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is very satisfying to see the culmination and conclusion of such an important report .
I should like to offer my warmest thanks to colleagues , the shadow rapporteurs , the groups and the officials who have made this outcome possible .
Reducing harmful alcohol consumption has in recent years become one of the priorities of health and social policies throughout the world , and the European Union is playing its part here too .
The European Commission gave us a text that contained a great deal of food for thought , which we have tried to build on and supplement .
Examination of the harm caused by alcohol abuse gave an extremely bleak and worrying picture : very high mortality among young people , in particular as a result of road accidents , ill-treatment in the family , growing numbers of cases of foetal alcohol syndrome , increasingly widespread liver disease and alcohol dependence , among young people as well , in all the Member States .
The costs of health treatment amount in Europe to EUR 17 billion , alongside the EUR 5 billion spent on treatment and prevention .
It should be stressed that it is alcohol abuse that is the problem ; alcohol consumption cannot be demonised per se since it is part of the culture , history and traditions of many Member States and the quality of some alcohol products in many cases makes them the jewel in the crown of the producer countries .
The employment aspect should not be forgotten either .
It is estimated that alcohol production and processing provides jobs for over a million people in Europe .
Another of the innovative points of the report , which has been welcomed by the Commission , is the idea of using the so-called brief intervention to disseminate a responsible and informed approach to alcohol consumption .
General practitioners , through the daily and direct relationship that they have with patients , could be a valuable resource for identifying alcohol-related problems even before patients themselves become aware of them : a simple questionnaire , known as an audit , which is already being tried out in some European cities , could supplement such personal action .
Other measures in particular include the promotion of measures to reduce the road accidents caused by alcohol abuse , for instance by stepping up checks on drink-driving , disseminating tests enabling people themselves to monitor their blood alcohol content , offering incentives for ' designated-driver ' programmes , lowering admissible blood alcohol contents and introducing harsher penalties for drink-drivers .
The European Union can try to stimulate , offer incentives for , promote and suggest the adoption of some of these measures .
One of the issues on which consensus was lacking was undoubtedly the question of labelling to highlight the risks and dangers of excessive alcohol consumption .
On a personal level , I feel that I should ask the Commission for a detailed study from which the various systems of information and communication , including labelling , can be drawn up .
In conclusion , the strategy , as amended by Parliament , could provide substantial added value over individual national policies , especially as it would be possible to direct the work of the Member States towards common objectives .
In the text of the report , I have tried above all to tackle this issue in a balanced and common-sense way , avoiding any demonisation of moderate alcohol consumption in order to take account of the centuries-old tradition of responsible drinking , and by trying to suggest measures likely to counter the problems which are unfortunately now so common in Europe and throughout the world .
I should like to thank everyone for their support and cooperation .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the excellent work and the very good report that he has produced , and also the other members of the committee who have supported him and worked with him in producing such an interesting , useful and positive report .
I do not want to repeat much of what has been included in the communication or in the report , and I begin by saying that I am very happy that we see eye to eye as to how we can solve and deal with such a difficult and important problem .
We know the statistics , which are worrying .
Almost 200 000 people a year in the European Union die of diseases related to excessive alcohol consumption .
We have 43-45 million people who drink at hazardous levels in the European Union which amounts to 70.4 % of all ill health and early deaths , and this is one of the largest causes of death among young people .
So the statistics are worrying , but we have to emphasise from the outset that we are not dealing with alcohol as a product on its own : it is the excessive consumption and the abuse of alcohol that are creating these problems .
Sometimes it makes it more difficult to educate and teach people how to consume , in moderate and more responsible ways , a product which has been around for centuries ; it is the excess or the abuse that is causing the problems .
I am very happy that Parliament agrees with the need for a European strategy and for European action in this respect .
It is true that we have to complement the policy of the Member States , as is stated in Article 152 , but that does not mean that we do nothing .
On the contrary , we are there to support , complement and add to the actions taken by the Member States .
It is also true that we have different cultures and different traditions in the Member States but , unfortunately , we now see the problems that until recently existed only in some Member States spreading everywhere in the European Union .
Unfortunately , bad habits travel fast and are very easily copied , especially by young people .
The possibility exists to exchange best practice through cooperation and working together , before it is too late .
We can take action before the problem gets out of hand , and this is one of the most important aspects of this strategy .
We should focus on young people .
Binge drinking is now a main concern regarding young people , but drink-driving is also one of the highest causes of deaths among young people .
At the same time , it is extremely important to focus on the priorities , and I am glad that the report agrees with the Commission on the main priorities , as I said , especially regarding young people , but also pregnant women .
Unfortunately , it is still a problem in the European Union that we still have children born with problems because of alcohol consumption during pregnancy .
One would have expected , in this day and age , with the highest level of education in the European Union , this would not happen , but unfortunately it does .
I have noted with great interest the reference made in the report to the problem among elderly people .
This will be seriously taken into consideration for the next actions because I can see that this can also be a serious social and health problem .
The European Union as a whole will work on two levels .
Firstly , there is the Committee on National Policy and Action , where the Member States are represented , and this will coordinate national alcohol policies and develop further policies , especially those identified in the communication .
But , at the same time , we also have the European Alcohol and Health Forum , where all the stakeholders are present and there we will develop concrete actions at the appropriate levels .
However , it will not be a debating society or just a ' talk show ' .
On the contrary , we are asking for firm commitments which will not only have to produce specific results but also will have to be made public and closely monitored , and the results of the monitoring will also be made public .
We are optimistic that this will be able to deal with some complicated issues , for example responsible marketing , responsible advertising - as identified in the report - and , at the same time , other aspects , like responsible serving , because it is not just the producers but also the retailers who have a serious responsibility in this area , and we will focus on this as well .
Most of the issues raised in the report confirm the policy orientations set out in the strategy outlined in the Commission 's communication .
Some points strive to further develop this strategy and , of course , I will pay close attention to these ; other points go beyond the recommendations of the Commission 's communication on some issues , such as labelling and taxation .
We will reflect on these issues as well .
Concerning the warning labels on alcoholic drinks , which I know has been an issue of great debate both when the communication was being drafted and in Parliament as well , we will study the experience obtained by Member States which are already in the process of introducing them and we will explore the possibility , in cooperation with the Member States , of developing official common approaches throughout the Community regarding this issue .
We have evidence that warning labels raise awareness - and that is why Member States introduced them - but , at the same time , they have to be part of a broader strategy ; on their own , they cannot achieve the goals we wish for .
Therefore , we need campaigns for raising awareness of education programmes .
For example , we can put warning labels on bottles , but what happens to drinks served in restaurants , bars and homes where the consumer does not see the bottle and , therefore , does not see the label ?
So we have to come up with new ideas , for example leaflets accompanying purchases of alcoholic beverages and advice from doctors , as was mentioned in the report .
These are important aspects .
Responsible communication , responsible sales and responsible marketing are also important aspects , and we have what is provided in the audiovisual services legislation .
However , through the forum , we can develop a code of conduct to be complied with by all stakeholders .
I should like to finish by saying that addressing alcoholic-related harm is a difficult challenge , precisely because we have to deal with one particular aspect , the excessive consumption and not the product itself .
However , I believe we are moving in the right direction , before the problem becomes unmanageable .
So I am looking forward to achieving concrete results , in the bodies I mentioned earlier , but , most importantly , in close cooperation with Parliament , and I am looking forward to your support in this continuous effort .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a fact that harmful and risky alcohol consumption has a considerable health , economic and social impact .
It is , however , also a fact that alcohol forms part of the European cultural heritage and the majority of Europeans take a responsible attitude to it .
So we do not want to condemn alcohol as such or lay down new laws .
What we want to do is to focus on groups at risk and risky situations .
A young person who drinks him or herself into oblivion , a pregnant women who damages her unborn child because of alcohol consumption , or a drunken driver who puts himself or others in danger : it is in precisely those areas that we need to act .
This report provides an excellent basis for doing so .
It is balanced , targeted and includes all stakeholders : Member States , the alcohol industry , retailers , the catering industry , doctors , schools and parents .
It clearly demarcates the various powers .
The Member States are the main players .
The EU only has a supporting role .
Its task is to collect data , point to well-established procedures and draw up and support information campaigns .
It is up to Member States to improve the implementation of existing national legislation .
What , after all , is the point of strict youth protection legislation if it is not observed and if offences go unpunished ?
We also recommend a 0.00 % limit for young newly-qualified drivers and professional lorry drivers .
The alcohol industry should undertake to refrain from directing alcohol advertising at young people .
My Group is not , however , in favour of obligatory warnings on alcoholic beverages , which is why I ask you to support the draft amendments deleting provisions to that effect from the report .
It is well known , and surveys confirm it , that warning labels have no effect in this case .
On the contrary , people need to be informed as early as possible about the dangers of alcohol abuse .
We must inform and we must convince , rather than prescribe and prohibit .
I think we have reached the point where we must realise that we are the representatives of the people , not their educators .
I thank Mr Foglietta , the rapporteur , for the close collaboration .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , fellow Members , I should like first to congratulate Mr Foglietta on his work .
He has produced a balanced report , showing a grasp of the problem and presenting sensible and generally speaking suitable proposals for dealing with the situation .
We agree with the objectives of encouraging responsible patterns of consumption and avoiding alcohol abuse in general and especially in the case of minors , pregnant women and drivers - we are all agreed .
The proposals presented by my Group are on the same lines : we are against alcohol abuse , but it is important to distinguish between moderate and responsible consumption and abuse .
Moderate and responsible consumption is not bad , on the contrary moderate consumption of wine , for example , is positively good for the health .
Also , habits in alcohol consumption vary widely in different parts of Europe .
In the south , there is a culture of moderate consumption of beverages , such as wine and beer , with a relatively low alcohol content .
Beverages of this kind are part of the culture in some parts of Europe and make an important contribution to the local economy .
So , in our view , it does not make sense to attach warning labels indiscriminately to bottles of wine like the labels on cigarette packets , for example .
Tobacco always damages health but alcohol only does in cases of alcohol abuse .
We also think information and awareness-raising campaigns are needed , to alert people to the risks of alcohol abuse .
These campaigns should start in schools .
This is a subject that must be approached sensibly , without preconceived fundamentalist ideas .
We are worried about the increase in alcohol consumption among young people , about the fact that they are starting to drink at an increasingly early age , mixing alcohol with drugs , and driving under the influence .
These situations must be dealt with by all possible means , both at national and at European level , because the future of our young people is at stake .
We agree with most of the measures proposed to address the risks arising from excessive consumption of alcohol by young people , and with the need for measures to tackle the harmful social impact of alcohol abuse , particularly domestic violence - we know that the incidence of domestic violence resulting from alcohol abuse is very high .
In most Member States , the laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to young people are adequate ; the problem is the low level of compliance .
Member States must strengthen the control mechanisms and secure compliance with the legislation involving the business sector , in other words we must all take responsibility and fight abuse , but we must not demonise moderate or irresponsible consumption .
Mr President , the European Commission puts the total economic cost of alcohol abuse in Europe at 125 000 million euros a year and estimates that it is responsible for a quarter of all crimes of violence .
Some more statistics : drinking alcohol during pregnancy is the leading cause of mental and physical defects in children .
About 1 % of the European population live with the effects of foetal alcohol syndrome .
That means nearly five million Europeans , when foetal alcohol syndrome is entirely preventable .
Sixty per cent of people who suffer foetal alcohol syndrome end up in prison or in psychiatric institutions .
This afternoon we had a meeting , organised together with Eurocare , with a visiting specialist from my own country of the Netherlands , Dr Nico van der Lely .
He said that the number of people requiring treatment for alcohol poisoning in his hospital , the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft , had doubled over a five-year period and that in children between the ages of 10 and 15 it had actually increased six-fold .
Binge drinking in particular , where you literally drank yourself under the table , seemed to be popular .
During the first half of this year a good 80 juveniles had already been admitted to the Reinier de Graaf Gasthuis in Delft as a result of excessive drinking .
There are many measures which can and should be taken .
Probably the most important factors here will be cost and availability plus , of course , education and information .
The question is : who is best placed to handle this ?
The situation varies widely from one Member State to another , as the Commissioner rightly points out .
So very often help will be given locally by local authorities and measures will most effectively be taken by doctors or the Member States .
And under the Treaty there is little scope for it to be otherwise .
It is important to have an ambitious alcohol strategy for Europe , but not to get in the way of Member States ' own plans .
Europe must lay down broad policy lines , and they must be clear .
Alcohol abuse needs to be tackled energetically , especially amongst the young , and Europe must give the Member States as much support as it can .
I am very loath to announce legislation which we cannot then carry through , because that does nothing to increase confidence in our institutions .
Mr President , I talked about foetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol abuse in juveniles .
It is indeed a European problem , as the Commissioner rightly says .
So I think the Member States must face up to their responsibility here and do so at European level .
I think that European level is the right place for agreeing clear targets for reducing foetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol abuse in juveniles .
And the resolution says as much .
To my mind it could have been spelled out in more concrete terms than it in fact is , but if the Member States are prepared to agree this , then at least we shall have some kind of a clear-cut result , because I do not believe in saying that subsidiarity is important but then doing absolutely nothing .
Lastly , I am keen to know what the results of labelling have been .
In France labels now carry a warning against alcohol consumption by pregnant women .
If we have those results and it appears that labelling works , I think we should consider similar action at European level .
There are also single-market reasons for doing so .
We can and should do this .
But I think we should only do it if it is effective , in which case I shall be happy to consider it .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Foglietta for his excellent work : his report very effectively tackles a tragically topical issue , that of alcohol abuse , in particular by minors .
It has already been said that the aim is in no way to criminalise consumption of alcohol which , when taken in moderate quantities , may well have health benefits .
The aim is rather to take a strong line against the spread of alcohol consumption among the very young .
Alcohol is often taken with drugs or alcohol itself may end up as a drug .
Alcohol abuse is now a social emergency among young people because it brings with it very serious physical and psychological damage , not to mention the victims of road accidents which are increasingly being caused by drink-drivers .
In Europe , Italy is sadly in the lead here with the highest number of road traffic accidents , half of whose victims are young people aged under thirty .
In the majority of cases , they lose their lives at weekends , during the evening , during the night , often returning from a party or a discotheque after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol .
In conclusion , Mr President , this is an excellent report , whose line we support as it is capable of reconciling prevention of the problem with appropriate action in terms of education and information and with zero tolerance for those failing to abide by the rules .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , a European alcohol strategy is long overdue , but we would have liked to have seen it brought forward more boldly and courageously .
We have heard about the horrendous costs of EUR 125 billion a year , not to mention the great human suffering resulting from accidents or domestic violence , or the 10 million children living in families with alcohol problems .
That is why it is important not to bow to the massive pressure being exerted by the alcohol lobby .
I am hugely disappointed by the announcements made by the speakers from the two big Groups , who obviously do not endorse the vote in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , whose key concern is to bring in warning labels together with bans on advertising .
Mr Maaten told us about the risks , about the major problem of drinking during pregnancy , about the appalling effects of foetal alcohol syndrome and the irreversible damage done to the development of the child 's brain .
We know about the experiences in the USA and today experts have again confirmed that warnings do have the required effect , especially in pointing out to pregnant women that drinking has devastating effects .
Why then are we not courageous enough to say that we are prepared to implement these ideas transparently and to use warning labels as wake-up calls for the women concerned ?
Why do we bow to the pressure of the lobby industry ?
I beg you once again from my heart : we would be acting like cowards if we gave way and did not have the courage to introduce those warnings , which have proved effective , and to endorse the vote by the Committee on Public Health .
The same applies to advertising bans .
We know , and the WHO has said it , that the European Union would save EUR 95 billion a year if we really introduced advertising bans and warning labels .
After all , we know that adverts are particularly persuasive in inducing young people to consume .
That is why I really can only beg you from my heart to have the courage tomorrow to implement this report .
Without legislative measures in the field of warning labels and advertising bans , the alcohol strategy will be a paper tiger .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Mr President , when I was discussing the original version of the strategy with an expert in the Czech Republic , he made just one comment : ' too little , too late ' .
I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for improving this outlook and for managing to give the text of this strategy a very positive direction .
I would like to stress the following points in particular .
Firstly , the amended text takes a positive attitude to the fact that it is necessary to spend more money on information and prevention programs to combat alcoholism .
Secondly , the strategy focuses on young people , who represent a category that is particularly at risk .
In this context , I welcome and support in particular Article 7 on university students and Article 16 , which makes it obligatory to include warnings on labels .
Thirdly , I believe that the text of Article 21 , which draws attention to the relationship between sick leave and alcohol consumption , is very important .
We must not forget that if the European workforce is affected by alcohol , it will not be very competitive in a global world .
I have a few doubts about the text of Article 2 , which refers to a study by the World Health Organisation about the usefulness of alcohol in prevention of some diseases .
With due respect to the WHO , I would like to point out that there are expert analyses available on this topic , such as the study by the team lead by Mrs Fillmore that was published in 2006 : these studies show that analysis of the benefits of alcohol was based on the wrong data and that it also included , for example , older people who have stopped drinking and casual drinkers .
The findings of this study are therefore fairly problematic .
There is also the question of the message we want to convey to citizens with this text in Article 2 .
I hope that the message is not that if alcohol is drunk in small quantities , no amount will prove harmful .
Although I have made this one criticism , I very much support the strategy , that is , the text that was amended in mutual cooperation with the rapporteur , and I believe that it will be beneficial for our fellow citizens .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( SV ) Mr President , in my capacity as shadow rapporteur , I want to thank Mr Foglietta for his excellent cooperation .
The report describes in detail the measures that should be taken by the EU to reduce alcohol-related harm in the Member States .
Criminal law is a national matter , however , not an EU matter .
We cannot have opinions on what sort of penalties the Member States should issue for drink-driving or how long driving licences can be withdrawn for these types of offence .
Criminal law is a strictly national preserve and must remain so .
It is also proposed that information campaigns be run at EU level even through it is in fact recognised that each Member State has its own drinking culture .
Each country knows best how to prevent alcohol-related harm on the basis of its own social experiences , traditions and resources .
It is beneficial to exchange information but the initiative must come from the Member States and not from Brussels .
The setting-up of a European prize is another way to increase the EU 's influence in these matters .
We need to review cooperation where the EU is competent , for example through the internal market .
The Environment Committee is trying to interfere with national matters .
So I now urge everyone to rap the committee 's knuckles .
And as far as the alcohol content limit is concerned , someone is equally dangerous whether they are a young driver , an old driver or a professional driver if they have been drinking and are out in traffic .
Mr President , I very much welcome this report and the compromise position that came from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , with the sole exception of the clause on labelling , which we will try to put right in the vote tomorrow .
I start from the belief that alcohol can be good for you in regular and limited quantities , particularly at the years of discretion which you and I have reached .
It is good for people as we approach maturity .
It is the third-biggest cause of early death .
That is why we need a sensible drinking policy ; that is why we urge the Commissioner to stick to that sensible message that he began with and why we would suggest that he does not go down the road of trying to harmonise criminal law , not least because you cannot harmonise the enforcement of criminal law , and we know that in drink-driving that is a major problem between Member States .
Equally , it is a mistake to try to harmonise labelling .
By all means , let us see what France does and let us learn from the lessons that it comes up with .
However , our message tonight is : let us have a sensible policy for sensible drinking , recognising the benefits but also the risks and the hazards of alcohol , some of which can be drunk to excess , some of which can be drunk to such excess that it is alcoholism .
But alcohol is with us and we need to learn to live with it .
( DE ) Mr President , our rapporteur and Commissioner Kyprianou made it quite clear in their opening statements that we are concerned not with condemning alcohol as a product but with its abuse .
Nor is this discussion about offering our citizens alcohol , as the report also makes clear .
Let me simply remind Members of the regulation on health-related information that we adopted in this House last year .
It bans health-related labelling on alcoholic drinks .
The European Parliament decided to endorse that too , on the basis of very good arguments .
The resolution incorporates the priorities set out in the Commission 's communication of last October - to reduce the number of injuries and deaths resulting from alcohol-related road traffic accidents .
The focus on alcohol abuse by young people and children is important , but it would be a strategic mistake to pretend that only young people are affected by alcohol abuse and its adverse effects in the European Union .
Precisely because alcohol and the moderate consumption of alcohol are important components of our European culture - and that should remain the case and nor should it be criticised - we must give particular priority to raising awareness about alcohol consumption during pregnancy .
The consumption even of small quantities of alcohol during pregnancy can adversely affect the child 's development .
I do not think the discussion about whether or not to introduce labelling will come to an end with tomorrow 's vote , and in fact Commissioner Kyprianou has indicated that the Commission will very carefully observe Member States ' experiences and then possibly take measures at European level .
Mr President , alcohol-related mortality and morbidity affect hundreds of thousands of EU citizens every year and alcohol competes strongly with tobacco as a main cause of preventable serious harm to humans .
Road traffic accidents , domestic violence , sexual abuse of children , hepatic cancer , liver cirrhosis and foetal damage are just some of the known detriments of alcohol .
Yet alcohol is widely available at affordable prices everywhere in Europe .
It is regarded as a necessary component in most social events , including many such events in the European Parliament .
Its production is supported and subsidised by the EU .
Its consumption is extensively and directly advertised on TV , radio and the press , and most alcoholic beverages carry no proper health hazard warning .
Why is this so ?
Why are national governments , national parliaments and the EU so tolerant of alcohol ?
Is it because of the very strong alcohol industry-related lobby ?
Is it because there is , historically , a general degree of naivety as regards this substance ?
Is it because of an as yet not well understood psychological or cultural factor ?
The sad fact is that the EU strategy in reducing alcohol-related harm has fallen victim to the same factors .
I dare say , respectfully , that this report , despite the noble intentions of the rapporteur , instead of tackling the problem drastically and effectively , merely scratches the surface and deals mildly mainly with heavy drinking and extreme drinking patterns , or drinking in particular circumstances , e.g. by children or pregnant women .
I am not advocating alcohol prohibition , but I believe that our chance as MEPs to deal with alcohol as a potentially killer drug of addiction , the use of which needs to be seriously , not mildly , restricted , has been missed .
Unfortunately , the alcohol lobby has succeeded once again .
This much watered-down alcohol strategy for Europe proved that the alcohol industry won and the EU citizens lost .
Just as a piece of information , alcohol acts by interfering with the function of neurones in the central nervous system and by killing nerve cells which can never be replaced again in a person 's life .
So , whether we drink little or much , the damage is there .
It is just the degree of damage that differs .
( SV ) I want to thank the Commission for its strategy .
It initiates an important and necessary discussion about alcohol in Europe even though many practical measures that I had wanted to see are absent .
Alcohol is not a normal product .
It has side-effects on health and the internal market must therefore take health considerations into account .
This does not mean banning alcohol .
It means a balanced policy with health warnings and a fair policy on alcohol imports and advertising .
No one is talking about a new EU competence here , only a better application of a competence .
Is a warning label and time limits for television advertising too much to expect ?
Is it too much to expect , having due regard to the subsidiarity principle , to recommend zero tolerance of alcohol on the road , which saves many lives ?
Many seem to think that only young people , pregnant women , professional drivers and addicts can have problems with alcohol .
That is wrong .
Total freedom for the alcohol trade is not liberal .
It reduces people 's freedom and increases the costs of healthcare unnecessarily .
It reduces the freedom to feel safe on the road .
It reduces the confidence in being able to go home safely from the pub and it reduces children 's safety in the home .
It is anti-liberal not to take health considerations into account in alcohol policy .
( PL ) Mr President , the resolutions that have been prepared and other preventative measures aimed at counteracting the negative effects of alcohol abuse cannot at the same time promote the consumption of alcohol advertised as being part of the European cultural heritage and lifestyle , as well as questionable WHO opinions about the health-promoting effects of alcohol , which are problematic , since the harmful effects of this product have been proven .
A liberal law allowing children and young people to consume addictive substances , including alcohol in tubes or alcopops , at a time where there is an epidemic of psychological disorders would be both careless and reprehensible , and cannot be considered as counteracting , but rather as promoting , alcoholism and other addictions .
Even the smallest dose of alcohol and narcotics given to a child is extremely harmful .
It should be a priority to impose a strict ban on the advertising and supply of alcohol and narcotics to children and young people , including when this is done in a covert manner .
( PL ) Mr President , alcohol abuse is currently a serious social problem in the European Union .
In fact , the highest percentage of persons abusing alcohol is found in Europe .
I do not believe , however , that one can make a comparison between tobacco products and alcohol .
While it has been shown scientifically that tobacco products are harmful , alcohol is harmful only when consumed in excessive quantities or by persons who should not drink it .
What is more , there is well-known research showing that small quantities of alcohol have a positive effect on circulation .
The issue here is the drinking culture and the promotion of social responsibility by alcohol producers in Europe .
Taking the above arguments into account , I believe there is no justification for labelling alcoholic beverages in a similar way to tobacco products .
On the contrary , it would be much more effective for reducing alcohol consumption to avoid expensive procedures for harmonising the manufacture of packaging and invest money in information campaigns .
It is our responsibility to reach high-risk groups such as pregnant women , young people and drivers through well-structured educational approaches .
It would be worth extending standard campaigns to include alcopops , alcoholic beverages frequently consumed by young people , which are generally considered to be fairly harmless or even as not containing alcohol .
Actions that I absolutely do support are moves to reduce to a minimum the permitted blood alcohol levels not just for young drivers , but also for persons working in public transport .
All these measures , which are essentially hardly coercive , are however enormously effective and will help to limit the consumption of alcohol in Member States .
It is also worth considering one additional issue : the consumption of alcohol and alcohol dependence , especially in young people , goes hand in hand with other addictions , which combine and often lead to tragedy .
It would be worthwhile for Parliament and the Commission also to consider these other addictions among young people .
( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , alcohol-related damage is a growing problem .
The figures speak for themselves .
Five per cent of men and 1 % of women are addicted to alcohol .
Twenty-five per cent of deaths in young people aged 15 to 30 are alcohol-related .
Child abuse is often the result of excessive drinking .
These figures often conceal a lot of suffering .
Addiction , medical problems , social misery , abuse , all these things are well known .
Less well known are the serious consequences of drinking alcohol when pregnant .
There may be serious harm to the unborn child .
Children with foetal alcohol syndrome are damaged for life .
It is increasingly recognised that drinking is extremely harmful to children and young people .
Youth drinking can cause lasting damage and can adversely affect academic performance and IQ .
Obviously , measures are needed quickly to dissuade youngsters and pregnant women from drinking .
One of the most effective ways may be health warnings on bottles .
So I urge Member States to bring forward proposals as soon as possible to make health warnings compulsory .
In the absence of any European legislation each Member State is free to make its own rules .
Warnings on bottles are effective , as studies in the USA have already shown .
And I urge the drinks industry to take responsibility itself for warning young people and pregnant women about alcohol .
Better to warn people now than face a whole lot of damage claims in ten years ' time .
Warnings are now a normal part of social responsibility , in which the drinks industry too must share .
Lastly , I call on the Commission to come up with adequate proposals at the earliest opportunity .
It is hard to see why warnings on cigarette packets have not been followed by warnings against alcohol .
So I urge the Commission please to waste no time in introducing measures to make health warnings aimed at young people and pregnant women compulsory .
It is important to place the health of the public above the interests of the wine industry .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on this important report .
I wish to draw attention to the role that alcohol plays in the incidence of suicide , with studies showing that over 20 % of persons committing suicide used alcohol prior to death .
Indeed , when the legal age for drinking alcohol was raised from 18 to 21 in the US , the most notable impact was on the reduction of accidents in the home , at work and on the roads , but there was also a 7 % reduction in suicides .
There are many excellent suggestions in this report that I support .
However , I have one slight reservation concerning the part of recital K which states : ' whereas measures should also be taken to prevent the consumption of alcohol by minors and pregnant women ' .
I know there are major issues with regard to foetal alcohol syndrome , and I am in favour of information labels , warning labels , curbs on advertising and pre- and post-natal support , but the suggestion that we should prevent pregnant women from taking a drink is a step too far .
We are not in the business of prohibition - that does not work - but we need what is proposed in this report , and much more .
( FI ) Mr President , Commissioner , the report fails to mention one crucial issue : a position on the price of alcohol and taxes on alcohol .
In Finland we have identified a clear link between the price of alcohol and its consumption .
The lower the price , the more it is used , and vice versa .
Raising tax on alcohol reduces its consumption .
In Estonia , our neighbouring country , the tax on alcohol is low .
Because of this , and because the EU prevents quantitative restrictions on imports , Estonia is causing a huge public health problem in Finland .
Finns can get cheap spirits in Estonia , less than 100 kilometres away , and that is stopping Finland from adopting what has been found to be the best approach , which is to impose a fairly high tax on alcohol for the sake of the health of its citizens .
Estonia 's cheap spirits , its policy if you like , and the resulting reduction in tax on alcohol in Finland , has led to almost a thousand alcohol-related deaths in my country .
In that way Estonia is killing Finns .
In this context , therefore , we need to speak about prices and taxes .
Mr President , in the US there has been warning of the effect of alcohol on babies in utero for 20 years because they had a problem with alcohol-related harm .
Only 20 % of American mothers-to-be drink in pregnancy .
In Europe , we do not label .
Eighty per cent of Irish mothers drink .
Seventy per cent of mothers in the UK drink .
I know mothers in Ireland .
I know that many of them would not drink if they understood the harm .
Labelling may not be an instant solution , but , over time , it is proved by the US experience that it has an effect and brings down foetal harm .
For adults , moderation is the key word , but for the child before birth there is no safe level .
Even low consumption can create organic brain damage that results in hyperactivity , impulsivity and even an increased risk of suicide .
There are learning and coordination difficulties as well .
One of the results of foetal alcohol exposure is a tendency for the child to grow up and to binge drink when he or she gets older .
That shows it becomes self perpetuating .
It is time to break this cycle .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , first I would like to welcome this strategy on alcohol which the Commission is proposing , precisely because it seeks to resolve the problem through prevention and education by publicising guidelines for moderate , responsible drinking .
I would also like to congratulate Mr Foglietta on his prudent report , but I would say once again that it is not alcoholic drinks per se that should be criminalised but abuse of them .
Moderate consumption of fermented drinks such as wine or beer by healthy adults is not only unharmful but even good for one 's health and can form part of a balanced diet .
Moderate consumption may protect the body from cardiovascular and degenerative diseases , as has been shown in many scientific reports .
Consumers are entitled to full , truthful information on the risks and benefits to health of alcohol consumption , but the appropriateness of health warnings on wine and beer labels must be called into question given that they have been shown to be ineffective in countries where they have been adopted .
Specifically , there is no scientific evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of health warnings on labels in terms of preventing abusive consumption .
Moreover , specific labelling for pregnant women would also appear to be ineffective .
The best ways to achieve the objectives set out are good awareness-raising and educational campaigns directed especially at pregnant women and young people .
I would also like to say that the recently established Forum on health and alcohol , which brings all interested parties together with the objective of combating excessive , abusive alcohol consumption , appears to me to be a very appropriate initiative and I hope that the Forum 's conclusions can also help to resolve this problem .
Finally , I would like to point out that the phenomenon of drunkenness in young people has gone hand in hand with a reduction in the per capita consumption of wine in the European Union .
I think that this is something to bear in mind because the issue is a good deal more complex than it would appear .
Mr President , tonight 's debate on an EU strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm should be wholeheartedly welcomed .
It carries on the work that I conducted in my report in 2001 on young people and alcohol and its negative effects .
The globalisation of the alcoholic drinks market and the increase in binge drinking across the EU is a phenomenon that politicians and health bodies alike are trying to grapple with .
In order to share best practice and to see how other countries are coping with similar problems , cooperation at EU level is essential .
For starters , one accident in four can be linked to alcohol consumption , with 10 000 people killed in alcohol-related road accidents in the EU each year ; 35 % to 45 % of traffic accident deaths are of young people aged 18 to 24 .
Drink-driving accidents are even more revealing : two thirds of the people involved were between 15 and 34 years old and 96 % were male .
Alcohol is estimated to be the causal factor in 16 % of cases of child abuse and neglect .
Take the subject of foetal alcohol syndrome ( FAS ) or foetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) : prenatal alcohol abuse is the commonest acquired cause of mental retardation .
More recently , medical professionals have stated there is no such thing as a safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy .
In 2001 , at the time of my report on young people and alcohol , FAS was relatively unknown .
Six years later there would appear to be more than acceptance of the argument that , if the same alcoholic beverage in the USA has an FAS health warning , why cannot the exact same product in the EU have the same warning ?
There is no difference between the two products : just that one is sold in the US and the other is not .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , various figures have been quoted this evening , and in the report by Mr Foglietta .
I would like to point out that behind these cold statistics there are , first and foremost , human tragedies .
I was head of a psychiatric hospital for some years and many of our patients were alcohol-dependent .
Paragraph 26 of the report states that we need to know the causes .
We have not talked enough about that this evening .
If we want to decide on the right action to be taken with young people , old people , men and women , we have to know the causes .
I am therefore urging that , in any action that is taken , more research is done in each of the Member States and in the European Union as a whole to find out more about why these young people feel the need to drink to excess .
Why , too , do old people , isolated at home , drink too much ?
Why do men drink at work ?
Until we have found out the real reasons for this over-consumption , we shall not be able to provide proper answers .
Mr President , overall I welcome this report .
I think it finds the right balance between recognising established cultural habits and the very worrying trend of harmful consumption of alcohol , particularly the growth in the hazardous binge-drinking culture among our young people .
The Commission in its approach identified key targets - protecting our children , combating binge-drinking , reducing injuries and deaths from alcohol rage , road accidents and the whole area of suicide .
My colleagues have pointed out the areas of concern extremely well .
I would now like to emphasise myself the need to add the serious risks of pre-natal alcohol exposure as a key target in the Commission 's list to be worked on , and for the health and alcohol forum proposed by the Commission particularly to take up this issue .
This is because the area of the pre-natal damage done by the consumption of alcohol is one very poorly understood by the public at large .
No amount of alcohol is safe during pregnancy , because alcohol is a teratogen .
In fact it is more dangerous during the second and third trimesters , which is what most pregnant women do not understand , because it is usually the first trimester that is the area of concern in terms of taking medication or drugs or any such substances .
Alcohol is particularly dangerous in the second and third trimesters .
Without shaming and blaming , we need to get an educational information campaign out through the Member States , through the GPs , to alert pregnant women immediately to the dangers of alcohol in this area .
Colleagues have mentioned ADHD .
There is also Asperger 's Syndrome .
The medical research community has had difficulty in getting published in this area , owing to the politics of alcohol .
Let your forum take over this issue and go further with it .
A final word on alcohol abuse as part of polydrug abuse .
In Ireland a fifth of those treated for problem alcohol use also misuse drugs , and a recent study in France found that driving under the influence of cannabis doubles the risk of being responsible for an accident .
The increasing prevalence of polydrug use needs to be addressed urgently by your forum too , and by each Member State , and the necessary technical supports to detect polydrug use , particularly at roadside police checks , need to be enhanced , with technical support being given to our police authorities .
( RO ) Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
The results of the report are meant to reduce the damage caused by alcohol and to protect the health and welfare of EU citizens , as we all know very well that alcohol is one of the most dangerous factors causing disease and premature death in Europe and also a series of social problems .
I appreciate that attention is paid both to reducing the harmful effects of alcohol on consumers and on third parties , vulnerable social groups , such as children , young people and pregnant women .
We can also add to all these , social damage such as domestic violence , neglected children , unemployment and social exclusion .
The importance paid to education , to information and education campaigns in order to prevent the dangerous and harmful effects of alcohol consumption , such as exchanges of best practices at European level , are important elements in reducing the harmful effects caused by alcohol .
The general approach of the report succeeded in bringing out the essential problems of alcohol consumption in the European Union and is an important step in the fight against excessive consumption .
( FI ) Mr President , the problems resulting from the dangerous and harmful consumption of alcohol have grown alarmingly in recent years in all the Member States of the European Union .
Our society pays a hard price for this every year , in terms of both direct and indirect costs .
The most acute problems of alcohol consumption relate to young people .
The young are more prone to physical and mental problems and to the social harm caused by their own drinking and that of others .
The problems of alcohol use , however , do not just concern the young .
Alcohol plays a part in the majority of homicides , and it causes 17 000 needless deaths on the road a year .
In the 1970s 200 people died of cirrhosis of the liver every year in Finland : now it kills 1 000 people a year .
At European level we need to take urgent action to harmonise the tax on alcohol upwards .
I would like to urge the Commission to draft ambitious common targets for the Member States to reduce the dangerous and harmful consumption of alcohol .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , European need not , may not and cannot regulate everything .
Member State subsidiarity and less bureaucracy are the slogans of the moment , which we keep repeating when we speak with members of the public .
The European Union 's competence is constantly being questioned , but Europe should and indeed must be the motive force for development .
The Commission 's right of initiative is a documented right .
Where no legislative instrument exists , it uses that right of initiative to focus on a thorny subject , draw Member States ' attention to abuses and call for action .
That is the legal basis of this Commission proposal , and we must use it .
We must curb the adverse effects on health of risky and excessive alcohol consumption and its social and economic consequences .
A European strategy is to be formulated in order to support the Member States in their endeavour to reduce and prevent alcohol-related damage .
That includes research into its root causes , as has just been said .
It also includes , however , informing , instructing and raising awareness among the public ; that is the crux of the matter , those are the key points .
Every individual is free to decide .
But individuals can use that freedom only if they are informed about the consequences and effects of their actions .
Upbringing and education are the key factors .
Upbringing within the family lays the foundations for a well-ordered and solid way of life , and we should put the focus on that , followed by schooling and advice .
The same applies to alcohol awareness .
I support Parliament 's report , which improves the Commission document in many areas .
I am , however , resolutely opposed to the calls for health warnings .
There are clear rules on the labelling of alcohol .
The labels indicate the alcohol content .
Transposing and understanding what it says on the labels is the basic way to pass on information .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is general knowledge !
Everybody must be in a position to use that information for themselves in a responsible manner .
The same applies to most things in life : to eating and drinking just as to exercise , sport and fitness .
( BG ) Mr. Chairman , Commissioner , it is a gratifying fact that the European Parliament is adopting this strategy as a timely and important measure .
The use of alcohol , which often turns into abuse , affects many people , including children and adolescents .
This is a threat which society still fails to recognize , probably due to information deficit .
The abuse of alcohol affects not only the individual health condition and reproductive health but it also damages healthcare systems , increases anti-social behaviour , leads to growing crime rates and drop-outs from school and , for this reason , to decline in the education rates .
Therefore we need public awareness , educational and preventive programmes to form a specific type of behaviour .
I find two key words in this report : risk and security .
For the purposes of achieving solidarity in the policy , the European Commission could discuss two important measures : to propose a targeted programme to be implemented by the Member States for a large-scale study of the impact of the use of alcohol and the impact of the awareness of this problem among citizens , and to establish a specialised fund for preventive programmes , where part of the revenues from advertising alcohol could be allocated .
( LT ) The battle against the harmful effects of alcohol is as old as time .
The Dry Law and various prohibitions that were applied in some countries did not produce positive results .
However , the Commission Communication on an EU strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol related harm is a very important initiative .
The Commission , having generalised the experience of the Member States and identified the problems common to them all , has introduced the priorities for reducing alcohol-related harm .
It is believed that implementation of the important priorities introduced , such as the protection of young people , children and unborn babies , the prevention of drinking when driving and other restrictions will make our society more responsible , healthy and abstemious .
I wish to emphasise the huge risks faced by young people drinking alcohol .
It is sad , but the permissible age for drinking alcohol is getting lower and lower in many countries .
Good practice is therefore very important .
I would like to propose linking the practice of reducing alcohol related harm in young people to EU programmes for young people .
The development and implementation of such programmes would help to occupy their leisure time and help to protect them from malignant alcohol consumption .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I believe alcohol was dangerous in the past and alcohol is dangerous today .
In paragraph 5.4.1 of its proposal the Commission rightly states that moderate alcohol consumption appears to offer some protection against coronary heart disease among people over the age of 45 , but I believe it is a myth , based on very weak scientific foundations , to say that a little alcohol is good for you .
Alcohol is dangerous .
It is a poison and even small quantities affect health .
Of course tolerance thresholds must be laid down .
We in the various European countries have learned how to handle the drug that is alcohol .
The British , for instance , seen in terms of consumer habits , are what is called binge drinkers .
Consumption per capita is relatively low , yet there are sometimes these excesses , which lead to serious damage .
We in Austria are so-called integrative drinkers .
We have a relatively high per capita alcohol consumption but fewer excesses .
There are , therefore , very wide national differences depending on national historical developments .
The Commission is taking the right approach to the problem .
It is saying that it will not relieve the Member States of their responsibility .
Yet there are European tasks that can be tackled together .
One example is the attempt to create a proper database .
The statistics vary widely .
It is a mistake to believe that we saw less alcohol-related damage in the past .
The diagnostic approach was different at the time , and there was less public awareness of the issue .
That is why I believe it is important for us in Europe to know what we are actually talking about .
It is also important to tackle new phenomena in consumption patterns .
One is the fact that growing numbers of young people begin to drink at a very early age , which causes very serious harm .
On the question of labelling in general , let me say that I think that falls short of what we need .
It would be wrong to believe that a phenomenon as complex as alcohol consumption can be resolved simply by putting a label on a bottle .
That would be an easy way of shirking our political responsibility .
( SV ) Mr President , I welcome the strategy even though I think that it has been watered down .
At last there is a single document with targets which can hopefully only be developed .
The positive thing about the strategy is that it shows which methods work in reducing alcohol consumption and thus in reducing damage and tragedies caused by alcohol .
But if the methods proposed by the report are to be used fully in the Member States , the EU 's legislation must be adapted .
First of all , import quotas must be reduced .
Each country 's efforts to work with restrictive measures are undermined or made impossible when alcohol may in principle be freely imported from other countries .
In addition , minimum taxes should be raised on public health grounds .
I would also like to see health warnings introduced on alcohol just as on tobacco .
I would therefore urge you to vote against amendments that weaken the text .
( FI ) Mr President , one of the most common proverbs in my country describes alcohol as the drink of the wise .
This is certainly not a message that alcohol would make anyone wise , but that it only suits those for whom a sense of occasion and moderation are familiar concepts .
I therefore have no problem agreeing when our Group 's shadow rapporteur , Mrs Sommer , draws attention to a strategy for preventing the dangers associated with alcohol .
We need to start by recognising the various alcohol cultures that exist and finding effective solutions to real problems , i.e. abuse and underage drinking .
There is no need to stigmatise the products themselves or moderate consumption .
We therefore need cooperation on the part of different agencies and national solutions to local problems .
On one issue I nevertheless want to see EU action , and that is an upward adjustment of the taxation levels for alcohol across a broad front .
We need to acknowledge that the costs of alcohol abuse to public health are massive , and they will not be held in check unless we have common economic policy instruments .
In this respect my own country is an unfortunately good example .
EU membership compelled Finland to lower tax on alcohol , when the right to restrict imports of alcohol ended .
A recent study shows that the number of sudden alcohol-related deaths has clearly increased since the tax on alcohol was reduced in 2004 and consumption began to rise sharply .
The rise was 17 % up on the figures for 2003 , and that does not take account of the other consequences .
Our public health problems are so serious that we are once again compelled to raise taxes .
At one time I myself simply proposed disobedience on the part of individual Member States , which is to say restricting imports after the transition period had ended , on the grounds of Article 30 or 95 of the Treaty .
Nothing was done at the time , unfortunately , and now the whole nation is paying the price , a nation which is obviously not wise enough .
( SK ) I was recently watching a television report about young people in Scandinavian countries who go on a boat trip on Friday evening to Estonia , for example .
Once there they buy two big cases of vodka and drink themselves into a stupor on their way back .
That said , similar and other variations on drinking to excess can be seen in all countries of the European Union .
There is no doubt that measures leading to lower alcohol consumption will have a positive impact on the health of the population , social conditions , accidents both at work and outside work , and traffic accidents .
I would like to focus on the damage done to health by excessive consumption of all types of alcoholic drinks .
It is necessary to keep pointing out , to young people in particular , that even regular consumption of beer leads to alcohol addiction that is no less serious than the alcohol addiction caused by wine or spirits .
It is terrible that people keep on frivolously underestimating the seriousness of liver disease , which can result often in cirrhosis and frequently in death .
Regular drinking gradually changes not only an individual 's desires and character traits , but can also destroy one 's family life , in addition to causing serious neurological changes on many occasions .
A young alcoholic loses his ability to strive for higher aims and ideals and his emotions become so numb that he finds it difficult to form healthy relationships or to have a healthy family environment .
Foetal alcohol syndrome seriously harms not only the mother but above all the child , causing developmental disabilities and malformations in new-born babies .
It is surprising how little attention is paid to informing pregnant women about this in many Member States .
Finally , the number of people who drive a car or a motorbike under the influence of alcohol is shocking .
I personally advocate the possibility of harmonisation right across the EU , where zero tolerance for blood alcohol levels in drivers should apply .
on behalf of ITS Group . - ( RO ) Mr President , dear colleagues , alcohol consumption is a habit transmitted from generation to generation .
In several countries there is a saying related to alcohol consumption , according to which it should be the exclusive concern of men .
There are not many approaches for reducing the harmful effects of the dangerous and noxious consumption on children and pregnant women .
Alcohol has more numerous and more various consumers than tobacco , traditional production techniques , meaning uncontrolled marketing methods and related risks .
In this case it is necessary that article 16 of the report encourage the approach of innovative means of disseminating information and awareness-raising related to alcohol consumption .
Instead , using warnings on the labels of alcohol products , similar to those for tobacco products , cannot be viewed an innovative approach since it has not proven adequately effective for tobacco .
It is necessary to carry out a European survey on the influence of this warning procedure for addicted consumers , regardless of their age , occupation and gender , but also for the internal market .
The European Parliament must put forward a resolution without any ambiguity , to give some time to draw up other information and awareness-raising methods so that it provides the Member States with an efficient framework for combating abusive alcohol consumption and promoting moderate and responsible alcohol consumption .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I should also like to thank all the Members for a very interesting debate .
I would like to tell you a story from Greek mythology .
You can find this story depicted in mosaics in Pathos in Cyprus .
It is the story of the first wine drinkers .
A servant of the god Dionysus stole wine to give it to humans for the first time .
They drank it , got drunk for the first time in human history , thought they were poisoned and killed the servant who had given them the wine .
In this day and age the solutions are much more complicated , and we must come up with a different approach .
Everyone has chosen a different approach .
Some say that we have gone too far , others that we have not gone far enough .
Some would have wanted us to legislate on everything , others that everything should be done by the Member States .
The fact is that the solution lies somewhere in the middle .
We are to complement Member States and support them in their policies , but that does not mean that there is no role for the European Union , as was reflected in the report and what Members have said .
At the same time , not everything can be solved through legislation .
We must , therefore , give the forum a chance to work and produce concrete results , which we will monitor .
However , at the same time , as has already been said , legislation exists in the Member States on many of these aspects .
It is implementation that is lacking and causing the problem .
Therefore , putting pressure on the Member States will help us to achieve positive results .
No matter what each side expected , we should not underestimate the importance of the fact that , for the first time , we have acknowledged at European level that there is a problem regarding alcohol-related harm , that there should be a European strategy - which has been adopted today - and that we now have a European debate , a European initiative and European action .
This is important .
No Member State can solve this problem in isolation and no Member State is immune from this problem .
There is now binge-drinking in Spain , which used to be a north-western European problem .
Therefore , one sees that , given cultural interchanges and other reasons - a social analyst could explain why this is happening - we have the same problems moving across borders , and there are no geographical barriers to such problems .
They exist everywhere in the European Union .
This is the first important step , though not the last one .
If we do not see a result within a reasonable time then we can re-evaluate , reassess and re-examine this strategy and take a different approach or a different course .
However , we are on the right track for now .
Once again , I would like to thank the rapporteur , the committee and the Members for supporting this strategy .
I look forward to working with you to achieve the results that we all desire .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( HU ) The excessive consumption of alcohol is a blight in European societies .
We are losing innumerable lives to illnesses caused by alcohol consumption , and the number of victims of drink-driving is also extraordinarily high in the Member States .
Alcohol consumption and habits vary from country to country and indeed from region to region and so it is proper that defensive strategies are created in the Member States .
There is still a need for individual EU directives .
Minors have to be protected in every possible way from alcohol , and to achieve this even more stringent sanctions are needed .
In the spirit of ' don 't drink and drive ' , zero tolerance and a 0.00 % blood alcohol level must be introduced for drivers throughout the entire EU .
But we will not make progress with prohibitions alone , as is so well demonstrated by the ignominious failure of the American Prohibition .
We must popularise good habits in alcohol consumption and the consumption of low-alcohol beer and wine .
We must act robustly against the trade in types of alcohol that are adulterated , fake , of poor quality and harmful to health .
in writing . - It is a worrying trend that in recent years alcohol manufacturers are targeting under-age drinkers with products such as ' alcopops ' .
Binge drinking is increasing amongst young people and it is important that we tackle this development effectively .
I believe that a good way to do this is to encourage supermarkets and shops to better separate alcopops from soft drinks .
Alcopops , along with other alcohol drinks , should also carry adequate health warnings .
I am pleased that my amendments along these lines were incorporated into the report .
Of course , to tackle under-age and binge drinking effectively , national governments must also focus on the consumer through changing attitudes towards alcohol .
I therefore welcome the focus on information and awareness-raising campaigns such as through school-based educational programmes .
I also support the recommendations that the limit for blood alcohol content ( BAC ) should be set as close to 0.00 % as possible , especially for new drivers .
I believe that the widespread availability of breath analysers , suggested in the report , can help to deter potential drink drivers .
National governments can do more to ensure the availability of public transportation for drivers who have consumed alcohol .
Dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption - Common organisation of the milk and milk products market - Additional rules on the common organisation of the milk and milk products markets ( debate )
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Elisabeth Jeggle , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 2001 / 114 / EC relating to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption - C6-0083 / 2007 - ,
the report by Elisabeth Jeggle , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1255 / 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products - C6-0084 / 2007 - , and
the report by Elisabeth Jeggle , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 2597 / 97 laying down additional rules on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products for drinking milk - C6-0085 / 2007 - .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , let me start by thanking Parliament , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in particular the rapporteur , Ms Jeggle , for this constructive report on the milk mini-package .
The package provides amendments for three legal acts .
The first concerns the Directive on preserved milk , in which we now allow standardisation of the protein content , totally in line with the Codex standards .
This meets a longstanding request from our dairy industry and exporters of milk powder , and their position vis-à-vis their competitors in third countries will clearly improve .
Not only industry and trade , but also milk producers - our farmers - stand to benefit because this standardisation of protein can yield a higher valorisation of the milk .
Furthermore , the forecasted strong demand for proteins will easily absorb the increase in the available quantities of proteins .
I welcome your full support for this proposal .
The second proposal concerns the common market organisation for milk and for milk products .
Here we propose a whole series of adaptations on which the European Parliament has expressed its full support .
These include the proposal to reduce the intervention price for skimmed milk powder as a mathematical result of lower protein content owing to standardisation .
It contains an elimination of the price-trigger system per Member State in the butter intervention system .
It also contains the abolition of the national quantities for butter as an eligible criterion for aid , removal of the obsolete aid for military forces and abandoning the compulsory use of import licences .
Your amendment for maintaining the private storage of cream and skimmed milk powder is a little surprising because these schemes have never been used in practice and can be considered obsolete .
Furthermore , private storage for butter is maintained , so there is really no need to maintain the scheme for cream .
Concerning your amendments on the school-milk scheme , we are on the same wavelength .
As we have proposed , the system will be simplified by introducing one single rate of aid .
DG AGRI was already exploring the different possibilities of reviewing the school-milk scheme and had invited Member States to provide suggestions for trying to improve the system , as well as for additional products to be covered by the scheme .
The resulting changes in the system will soon be presented in the Milk Management Committee .
I hope that an agreement between Parliament , the Council and the Commission can be found on the increased aid level for school milk , up EUR 18.15 per 100 kilograms .
Concerning your amendment that would introduce a milk fund to finance a restructuring programme , I would underline that the proposals contained in the milk mini-package are really not of a restructuring nature .
I therefore have great difficulty in correlating these basic technical and simplification measures with a perceived need to establish a new ' milk fund ' budget line .
Discussions on the need for appropriate measures for the milk sector should take place in view of the upcoming health check discussions and the various discussions we will have on the future of the common agricultural policy .
The third act concerns liberalisation of the drinking-milk market , where I note that we are also on the same wavelength .
The suggestion to delete the 0.2 % tolerance for the fat contents seems to be acceptable .
You also propose that a reference be made to Directive 2000 / 13 / EC .
Please be informed that this Directive automatically applies .
So , all in all , I note with pleasure that our views are in line with one another .
Thank you for all your work .
I look forward to our continuing discussion tonight .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , everyone is talking about the good and stable market situation for milk and milk products at the moment and the resulting rise in milk prices .
The rise in milk prices urgently needed by farmers is providing new fuel for the much-disputed question of quotas .
Today I want to discuss the mini milk package and begin by taking the opportunity to thank the Commissioner and her colleagues for the good cooperation .
They have presented three good and well-thought through proposals and Parliament is , therefore , not tabling many amendments .
I do believe , however , that our draft amendments provide some food for thought and I hope the Commission and the Council will endorse them in the same way as the Committee on Agriculture .
The first report submitted by the Commission contains amendments to the Council directive relating to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption .
In this report , the Commission proposes standardising the protein content at a minimum of 34 % , expressed in fat-free dry matter .
That standardisation will make it possible for European manufacturers to compete with manufacturers in third countries under the same conditions .
This simplification of international trade is welcome and is one reason why the Committee on Agriculture adopted this report without amendments and with only one vote against .
Such standardisation saves money , which is why in the second report I proposed a milk fund programme to ensure that the milk sector could retain any saved money .
The Commission proposal amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products provides for several important technical adjustments , which will clearly also lead to improvements .
Firstly , it will reduce the intervention price for skimmed milk powder by an average of 2.8 % .
By removing the intervention trigger for butter , abolishing national quality classes for butter , introducing a standard quality definition , removing disposal aid for military forces and abandoning the compulsory use of import licences , we are reducing the red tape .
I am , however , quite definitely against abolishing private storage for cream and skimmed milk powder .
It represents a safety net and I believe we should discuss this in the context of the Health Check and not of the mini milk package .
Aside from that , the proposal to introduce a single rate of aid for school milk is no doubt right .
Given the nutritional importance of school milk , however , the aid for products falling within that regulation should be increased substantially , from EUR 16.11 per 100 kg to EUR 18.15 per 100 kg .
It is also urgently necessary to broaden the range of products .
Some fantastic new milk , quark and yoghurt products are now available , which can cater for everyone 's tastes and likes , and if we introduced innovative school programmes we could whet children 's curiosity about those products while also doing something for nutrition .
The potential EUR 117.3 million in savings resulting from the standardisation of protein for the period 2008-2013 , or possible further savings within the milk market organisation , should be used to accompany and support milk sector reform .
I would be quite prepared to discuss that too in the context of the Health Check debate .
This measure is intended to facilitate our proposed milk fund programme .
The resources could be used , in the context of promoting milk sector sales , for better nutritional information and also for further accompanying measures such as modernising milk production , in areas where conditions are more difficult and in mountainous regions .
The committee unanimously adopted this second report .
The third report concerns drinking milk .
It proposes increased flexibility in the definition of drinking milk .
The current regulation recognises three categories of drinking milk that can be produced and marketed in the Community .
These are skimmed milk ( maximum 0.5 % fat ) , semi-skimmed milk ( 1.5 % to 1.8 % fat ) and whole milk ( at least 3.5 % fat ) .
The Commission 's proposal to allow the production and marketing of drinking milk that does not comply with those three categories , as long as a clear and easily readable indication of the fat content is given on the label , is right .
This liberalisation measure will not only mean that transitional national derogations can be removed but also broadens the consumers ' options , which could certainly help revive intra-Community trade .
To avoid any uncertainty , the fat content percentage of the milk should be clearly visible on the packaging and directly linked to the product description .
Yet I think it is unnecessary to set a tolerance margin of + / -0.2 % when indicating the fat content , since that would not improve clarity but be more likely to hinder implementation .
These two draft amendments , like this third report , were also adopted unanimously in committee .
Given the clear position taken by the Committee on Agriculture , I am confident that the entire mini milk package will be endorsed by a clear majority during tomorrow 's plenary vote too .
I cannot , however , accept the ALDE Group 's three draft amendments .
They do not substantially improve the report .
The third draft amendment refers only to school milk , which would go against what we want , namely to improve supply of the entire range of products .
That is why I must , unfortunately , reject that draft amendment too .
I extend warm thanks to all colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and in the Group .
I thank them for their trust and for the good working relationship .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Jeggle on her three reports - the mini-milk package .
It was very clear right from the start that there was general agreement on her reports , and that was demonstrated by the Commissioner .
Members asked for this debate so that they could discuss the wider issues affecting Europe 's dairy industry , and I will be no exception to that .
Until very recently , dairy farms were the Cinderella sector of the UK farming industry .
Thanks to murky economic practices , which allow supermarkets to squeeze down the price of milk to 17p per litre while they sell it on to the public at 50p a litre , many of our dairy farmers were going out of business .
It is worth remembering that even at 50p per litre , milk is still half the price of bottled water in our supermarkets , and you do not have to calve a bottle of water or send for the vet to attend to its needs .
Until quite recently , of the 27 EU Member States , only Slovakia , Estonia , Hungary and Lithuania had lower milk prices than the UK , and the result has been that in the last five years in my constituency in Scotland we have lost around 500 dairy farmers .
There are now an estimated 1 400 dairy farms left in Scotland - that is all .
It is estimated that across the UK one dairy farmer is leaving the industry every day .
It is only now as world cereal prices - in particular wheat - have almost doubled , forcing up the price of feed , and as pressure on productive farmland grows for biofuels and other non-food crops , that some supermarkets have finally begun to panic at the prospect of an actual milk shortage and , as a result , have started paying dairy farmers a slightly higher price .
At long last , dairy farmers have begun to see some light at the end of the tunnel and they are at least getting more than the cost of production for their commodity .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , I would also first like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work which has allowed us at all times to feel comfortable with her proposals .
I would also like to thank her especially for allowing the oral amendment I tabled on the school-milk scheme .
Having said that , what I would like to do is reiterate my criticism on moving this mini-reform forward when major reform of the COM is anticipated next year and November will see a CAP ' Health Check ' , and as yet , Commissioner , we obviously do not know whether this will have any consequences for the sector .
But today , Commissioner , reality , and Mr Stevenson explained this , is taking us in other directions .
The price crisis in agricultural produce has resurrected the debate on the issue of agricultural food production in Europe .
My assessment of the milk crisis differs from yours .
In my opinion , the main cause of the rise in milk prices lies not in increased consumption in Asia but in low Community productivity .
Indeed , yield last season was the lowest of the last 15 years .
Some organisations say that Europe is likely to need an extra thousand million litres per year to satisfy its needs .
Certainly , today , consumers are overwhelmed by the increase in prices of basic foods and farmers in turn by the price of cattle feed .
Although like you I am of the view that producing biofuels is neither the ultimate nor the main cause of the rise in prices , we should not be fooled , there are others .
Neither a fall in set-aside nor a reduction in fallow land will be enough to stabilise prices .
The Commission should be very alert to other types of current speculation , such as the speculation on the stock markets .
Large groups will easily be able to pass the increase in prices of raw materials on to the consumer , in fact they are doing this already , but this will be much more difficult for local producers to do , and therefore the rise will penalise the more fragile SMEs most of all .
Indeed , as Mr Stevenson has just said , the increase is not being reflected in the price charged by farmers ; they blame the gap between the price paid to them and the price paid by the consumer on a Common Agricultural Policy based on promoting set-aside .
That being the case , Commissioner , I would advise you not to come here and tell us that quota removal will be implemented gradually .
The arduous job of the dairy farmer is compounded by difficulties in obtaining a quota , difficulties in obtaining cattle ...
Were you aware , Commissioner that at present European dairy-farmers are having to go to countries like Canada or the United States to buy dairy cows because they cannot find cattle to buy in the Community market ?
In view of all this , Commissioner , I would ask you to react , and I am sure you will , appropriately to these new circumstances , circumstances that were unthinkable only twelve months ago and whose consequences for the agricultural food production sector we should begin to debate .
In my opinion we should not merely hope , as I have read in your blog , that the competitiveness of European farmers in world markets will not be too badly affected , but react rapidly to prevent that from becoming the case .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , first I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Jeggle , for her excellent reports .
Milk is one of the most important areas of agricultural production .
It is all the more important as beef production is largely dependent on the calves which dairy cattle farms produce .
Milk production is also eminently suited to areas where natural conditions are poorest .
For example , dairy farming in northern Europe can effectively exploit the fact that the arable land there is an excellent source of coarse fodder , which also makes production resistant to rain , frost and other unfavourable natural conditions .
The proposals before us will simplify EU laws on the dairy industry .
The quality class system for butter would be simplified , the strict classification for fat content abolished , aid for school milk made independent of its fat content and the intervention system clarified .
These measures seem positive ones and I want to thank Commissioner Fischer Boel for these reforms .
The big question is the overall reform of the milk sector , which is to take place in the near future in connection with the Health Check , the mid-term review of the CAP .
Its main focus is milk quotas .
The current balance in milk production has been achieved thanks to milk quotas .
It is because of these that the 1 300 million kilo butter mountain , which we still had at the end of the 1980s , has melted away and at the same time it has been possible to guarantee consumers a steady supply and diverse range of agricultural produce .
A predictable framework within which milk producers can develop production has also been established .
In my opinion , it is the EU 's obligation to guarantee such predictable frameworks for milk production in the future too .
This is important because the necessary investments are made to cover periods of time lasting decades and they are massive sums for family farms .
Furthermore , the regulation of production is a slow process because it takes around two years before cows are ready for production .
That is why it is in the interests of both the consumer and producer to continue with milk quotas .
If the quotas are abolished it will mean the investments that farmers have made buying quotas and thereby stabilising production conditions will have gone to waste .
With these observations , we would like to support the reports presented .
on behalf of the UEN group . - ( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , in taking the floor in this debate , I would like to draw attention to the following issues : first of all , I would like to support the rapporteur 's proposal that the savings made as a result of this reform , i.e. the sum of EUR 117 million , could be used to create a milk fund .
Secondly , this fund should be allocated primarily to those milk producers and processors who , as a result of the increasing market liberalisation , have to carry out restructuring at their farms or companies , and also to promote the consumption of milk and milk products , and , particularly , to increase financial support for supplying milk and milk products to schools .
Thirdly , the Commission 's proposal concerning abandoning the three categories of milk that have been marketed to date , i.e. skimmed , semi-skimmed and full cream , also deserves to be supported .
As a result it will be possible to market milk with any fat content , provided that this is marked clearly on the packaging .
While supporting the solutions contained in the reports prepared by Mrs Jeggle , I would however like to remind Commissioner Fischer Boel that a serious debate is needed on the subject of the amounts and the future of the milk production quotas that are in force in the European Union , since these are glaringly unjust , especially for the new Member States .
Commissioner , you promised us this debate when responding to my question on this matter , which was addressed to the Commission in October 2006 .
A country such as Poland , with 38 million inhabitants , has a quota of about 9 million tonnes , giving 0.23 tonnes per inhabitant , whereas this amount is 0.33 tonnes in Germany , 0.39 tonnes in France and as much as 0.67 tons in the Netherlands .
Poland , which even now has excellent possibilities for developing milk production , just three years after joining the EU , is already very close to the maximum limit and cannot develop it further .
This has a very negative effect on the profitability of farms that have specialised in milk production .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Mr President , I shall be no exception in this debate in offering my group 's congratulations to the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work which has achieved the fairly unusual feat of keeping everyone pretty well happy .
I would also praise the Commission for acting on this ahead of the health check , because this is a good piece of work which is long overdue .
I shall summarise our own view on the initial comments here from the National Farmers ' Union of Scotland briefing .
The proposed changes do not necessarily have a direct impact on farmers , but they will lead to simplification , cost savings and efficiencies further up the chain , all of which will improve dairy sector competitiveness and as such should lead to an indirect benefit to farmers through the marketplace .
In my view , the simplification of the school milk regime is particularly to be welcomed .
What better way to fulfil so many agricultural , economic and health aims than by encouraging the drinking of milk and milk products by Europe 's children ?
Making the system more logical is , if we are honest , long overdue .
In praising this package I must agree with my Scottish - if not political - colleague , Mr Stevenson , in pointing to the elephant in the room that is the poor prices that farmers still have to endure , because the supply chain is beyond breaking point and too many of those involved in the market are abusing their position .
We in the Commission and Parliament here tonight have done our part by making the system simpler .
We could just as well ask why it was so complicated in the first place , but we have done our job tonight .
Now national and EU competition authorities must intervene forcefully on the side of farmers who , because of de facto abuses of dominant positions in the market by supermarkets in particular , are continuing to receive a pittance for their quality products .
As the Commissioner says , the health check is a good opportunity , because until the EU takes action to tackle that elephant in the room , all the good efforts like this package will continue to be overshadowed and lose out in the noise .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( PT ) Generally speaking , we agree with Mrs Jeggle 's proposals in the three reports she has presented , notably the proposal to use the budgetary savings to set up a restructuring programme which could be used for marketing support and nutrition information on quantities of milk and milk products .
Similarly , we think it is important to strengthen the scope and quality of the school milk scheme by extending the range of products that can be included in the scheme , operating as a genuine programme to encourage consumption of milk and milk products , more in line with the tastes of children and young people and paying due attention to nutrition and balanced diet .
We also agree that there should be very clear rules on labelling drinking milk , as it seems to us quite right that the fat content should be included in the so-called ' product description ' .
( SK ) In the context of the dairy ' mini-reform ' being debated , I would like to put special emphasis on the need to adopt at this sitting Amendments 5 and 7 to the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk .
Amendment 5 provides for a single rate of aid of EUR 18.15 / 100 kg of all milk in the school milk scheme .
There is no doubt that by increasing the aid and simplifying the regime we will help to achieve the goals of ensuring healthy eating and combating obesity among young people .
Amendment 7 sets out the main objectives of the milk fund restructuring programme .
The objectives of this programme , such as strengthening nutrition awareness measures and increasing milk consumption , as well as modernising milk production for example in mountain regions , are an incentive for the new Member States in particular .
After all , in recent years many new Member States have seen an incredible reduction in milk production and in the number of cattle of more than 50 % .
Unfortunately , milk consumption has fallen as a result , to below the amounts recommended by doctors , particularly among children .
By approving these three texts the European Parliament can help to achieve a balance between the consumption and production of milk in all countries of the European Union .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to join the rapporteur in extending thanks , for I think the overwhelming endorsement in committee is enough to show what good work has been done here .
The mini milk package is an important step not just for European farming and the milk sector , but above all for promoting the use of milk in nutrition .
Balanced nutrition is especially important for children , and here milk and milk products have a major part to play .
The healthy development of our children is determined by the supply of healthy foods , such as local milk products .
That is why it is most important to promote milk and all the various milk products , from yoghurts to soft drinks and low-fat products , which children and schoolchildren love so much .
One reason why it is important to promote sales of milk and milk products is that it is becoming increasingly clear that unhealthy eating is leading to a growing number of health problems among Europeans too .
The advertising budget contained in the mini milk package will increase people 's awareness , which will in turn benefit the population as a whole .
It is vital to ensure that the savings resulting from the reform remain within the milk sector .
In conclusion , let me say that direct production prices for farmers are finally rising , although this is certainly not due to the fact that we are now producing bio-energy but is mainly the result of environmental disasters and better markets within the EU and outside it , i.e. in third countries .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her excellent work .
I particularly support her objections to the abolition of private storage aid for cream and skimmed milk powder and the wish to introduce a single rate of aid for milk distributed in schools .
However , along with some of my colleagues , I should like in particular to mention the current milk shortage , which is undoubtedly due not just to an increase in worldwide demand but also to a reduction in supply which could have been anticipated because it was , in my view , foreseeable .
Due to the reform of the CAP and the fall in the price paid to milk producers , some farmers , such as those in France , have got rid of some of their dairy cows and are focusing more on beef and veal or , in Germany for instance , have given up rearing cattle altogether and are growing cereals instead .
As a result , France has 100 000 fewer dairy cows than it needs to fill its quota and the European Union needs one billion litres of milk to meet European demand .
That shortage is already having and will continue to have serious effects on the prices of milk and hence milk products , as well as on the prices of various other food products .
In addition to those increases , the price of other basic foodstuffs such as cereals and meat will rise as a result of the rising prices of animal feed .
Obviously that is going to cause extra difficulties for consumers .
It therefore seems to me necessary to introduce price stabilisation instruments .
Finally , I should like to draw attention to the even more difficult situation of milk producers in mountain areas , the producers I represent .
Their production costs are higher and supplies are more difficult .
What is more , in some countries such as France they are faced with a reduction in the collection aid that offset part of the extra cost of collection in mountain areas .
Milk production is one of the sectors that make the biggest contribution to land conservation and land use planning , especially in problem areas .
I hope , therefore , that proper consideration will be given to the specific problems of the mountain areas in any future debates on the CAP review and the new CAP .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ' milk is good for you ' and today everyone is talking about it .
Milk is the oldest energy drink in the world , it is a particularly important product , and it is good that we are debating it today .
What we call the mini milk package , made up of three documents , is only one , albeit very important , building block in the further simplification of EU legislation in agriculture , and in principle the Commission 's reform and simplification measures in this connection are most welcome .
As we know , reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is a long-term , continuous process and the proposed mini milk package is a step in the right reform direction .
Rome was not built in a day , however .
The Commissioner knows that better than anyone .
I would like to address an important political aspect that some colleagues have already discussed : school milk .
Here the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has called for an increase from EUR 16.11 to EUR 18.11 per 100 kg .
That is a sensible correction and we were right to call for it .
Perhaps we could now seriously consider a school fruit programme , which would probably also please the Commissioner 's colleague , Mr Kyprianou .
I also welcome the standardisation of the protein content of milk and milk production because it allows European producers to enter into fair competition with their third-country competitors , given that competition is a basic liberal concern .
At the same time it is right , important and also urgently necessary for milk producers and dairies to pool their resources even more , so that it becomes even easier for them to assert their interests on the market .
A good deal of work on the ground is still required here too .
Let me put forward an idea from the consumers ' point of view , and looking towards the future .
The demand for milk has risen worldwide .
It is particularly clear that living and eating habits are changing in Asia as a whole , i.e. demand is rising and prices are rising .
It is a pity that the higher prices are attributable above all to trade .
Yet we must also be honest with our citizens .
To some extent the higher prices tell the environmental truth .
For instance , it is not comprehensible that a litre of milk now costs less than a litre of water .
Butter is cheaper now than it was 20 years ago .
We certainly must tell the citizens that there are of course also some improvements .
The money should remain in the sector , however , and not go to trade .
A word on the quota .
Evidently we will still have the quota for some time .
That has been debated here and the reasons for having that quota have been given .
Yet the current milk quota must expire in March 2015 , and not just for German farmers who could then profit from the rising global demand for milk and products .
What the Commissioner said when she was thinking out loud of considering actually raising the quota could be taken to mean it needs removing .
We should be honest here and call for its removal .
I thank Mrs Jeggle for what was , on the whole , a very good report .
I wish the Commissioner all the best on the way to further reforms of the agricultural policy .
( PL ) Mr President , the proposed changes to the milk market and the creation of a milk fund are meant to provide support to farmers and consumers , not to damage the existing situation .
There is no doubt that provision must be made for exceptional circumstances and a legal basis guaranteed for the storage of milk products in different conditions .
A particularly important part of the battle for healthy food is to provide support for agricultural production in mountainous areas .
Good quality milk is produced there because of the relatively low levels of pollution .
It is equally important to give the public accurate information about the product , i.e. milk , as well as about the country and producer responsible for its manufacture .
This should include information that genetically modified plants were or were not used during its production .
This is particularly important when giving milk to children .
Finally I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her excellent report .
Mr President , there are three points in the report on the common organisation of the market in milk which I strongly support .
One : private storage of cream and skimmed milk powder should not be abolished , but retained as a safety net in the volatile world of milk production .
Two : the school milk scheme is of critical importance , not least in the fight against obesity , and it should be widened to include new and healthy dairy products .
Three : a milk fund restructuring programme should be set up for the purpose of retaining for the milk sector savings resulting from the implementation of the mini-milk package , with such a fund being used for marketing support and nutrition awareness .
Though , at present , the outlook on milk is more optimistic , we need to be sure that no steps are taken that would remove the current safety nets or fail to expand the vision for milk .
Nor should savings made be lost to the industry and its promotion .
( NL ) Mr President , this late in the day , when only our dogged spokesmen on agriculture and the agriculture Commissioner are still with us - for which my thanks , Commissioner - milk may not be the most obvious refreshment we are thirsty for , especially after the previous debate .
But we must not forget that we are talking here about one of the giants of European agricultural production .
Every Member State of the EU is a dairy producer and dairy accounts for no less than 14 % of Europe 's agricultural output .
Notwithstanding its relatively modest share of the farm budget , it must be said .
The dairy sector also offers us quality products and a choice of regional specialities .
General De Gaulle made a connection between this great diversity of products and his country 's governability .
' How can you govern a country which has 246 kinds of cheese ? ' he asked rhetorically .
What this French observation might mean for a European Union of 27 Member States and no doubt thousands of kinds of cheese , well , we won 't go into that this evening .
We must not forget the contribution which dairy farmers make to our countryside .
A sector to be proud of , then , but one which has not had an easy time of it in recent years .
It is tempting , in the light of those difficult years and present-day market developments , to dwell on questions which go beyond the scope of this debate .
I shall be the exception to the rule and will not do that , though most Members have given in to the temptation .
I will merely echo Struan Stevenson , who quite properly asks how much of the price rise actually feeds through to the farmers .
Back then to the subject of our debate : Mrs Jeggle 's most excellent reports .
I specifically want to address the call to widen the school milk scheme .
The link between fat percentage and support has rightly been scrapped , so to me it makes sense , in widening the scheme , to think above all about innovative and healthy products , especially in view of Europe 's growing obesity problem .
The Commissioner has already said that she is having talks on this with the Member States , but maybe she can tell us when we can expect concrete proposals on the subject and consequently when this package is actually likely to be expanded .
Lastly , I agree with the rapporteur that it is too soon to do away with existing safety nets altogether , even if they are not currently used , but that this too is a matter for the Health Check .
' To be continued ' , is the message , then .
( HU ) I warmly compliment Mrs Jeggle on her outstanding work and would also like to welcome the Commission 's mini milk package .
In the new Member States it has so far been possible to deviate from the EU regulations on fat content , due to the hard-won derogations , but it is good news that after 2009 we will still be able to consume the milk products to which we are well accustomed .
With the anticipated intensification of trade between the Member States as a result of liberalisation , we have to be ever more alert to the issue of food safety .
I would like to draw the Commissioner 's attention to the fact that food safety poses an ever greater problem throughout the whole of Europe , and one which is particularly pertinent to the new Member States .
I support the proposal adopted by the Committee on Agriculture that the budget savings from standardisation must remain within the milk sector .
This money must be devoted to two aims .
One is the reorganisation of the milk support and the other is the school milk programme which is an excellent initiative by the Commission .
The programme is one of the fundamental elements of healthy nutrition in the fight against obesity and weight gain .
Support for this programme must be increased .
I would like to point out to Mr Chatzimarkakis that he is knocking at an open door , since eighteen months ago I proposed a school fruit programme which Mrs Fischer Boel accepted to such an extent that it now forms part of the already completed fruit and vegetable reform .
The school milk programme and the school fruit programme complement each other very well .
Many people have mentioned the quota system .
It is both evident and to be feared that the Commission will scrap it but nonetheless I would ask that what happened with the maize intervention should not be repeated .
Let there be a ' soft landing ' , let there be a preparatory period for the milk producers .
I am afraid that the increase in the national quota and the abolition of fines will lead to the devaluation of quotas in the years that follow .
( PL ) Mr President , the common organisation of the market for milk and milk products is an important issue both for individual Member States and for the entire European Union .
We are all agreed that it requires certain changes , but these should be based on the results of thorough research , and not on industry or trade lobbying .
We must remember that our objective should always be the good of humanity and in this case that of consumers , who have the right to expect us to protect their interests .
In this context the proposal from the European Commission to abolish the tolerance of plus or minus 0.2 % for the fat content in milk for human consumption in relation to the value given on the packaging is unacceptable .
Improvements to the organisation of the milk market should begin with a review of milk quotas and then allocate them on the basis of consumption .
We cannot have a situation where , for example , Germany , with 80 million inhabitants , has a milk quota of over 28 600 000 tonnes , whereas Poland , with 38 million inhabitants , has less than 9 million tonnes .
The Common Agricultural Policy , including the milk policy , also needs questions to be asked such as : what model of agriculture are we supporting - is it family agricultural holdings , or farmers with thousands or tens of thousands of hectares ?
If it is to be the family holdings , which are the ones I am considering , then there is no need to finance private storage on the farms .
These funds would be better used for the proposed milk fund , which would serve , among other things , to disseminate information on nourishment from milk and milk products , to support the ' school milk ' scheme , to provide support for the production of regional products and for restructuring the milk industry .
President , I too should like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her expertise in handling these reports .
It makes sense to simplify but not to radically change at this stage .
I suppose it is a funny old world , because not that long ago , it was doom and gloom in the dairy sector and it is incredible how buoyant and resilient farmers are that this summer , for the first time in a long time , I saw smiles on their faces because milk prices are recovering .
Consumers are noticing - and Tesco is actually saying - that the long-term trend of declining spend on food has stopped .
Sir Terry Leahy , Tesco 's chief executive , recently said that there is a fundamental shift in the priority consumers place on food and I think that is true , and it is welcome , and I hope it signifies a move away from the ' slash and burn ' policy of supermarkets in relation to food .
Obviously we are trying to be specific in relation to milk .
All of us want to know what your plans are on milk quotas , given the market situation we now face .
And we look forward to hearing that .
I read too that China is anxious for its children to be able to have access to milk and it is extraordinary that with that in mind , our children in Europe are apparently drinking less and less of it .
However , in relation to the school milk scheme , which is vital , can I just give you the views of Áine - who happens to be one of my own and who is aged ten .
She has just opted out of the school milk scheme and I think it is interesting why she has done that - she actually loves milk - but she would rather be outside playing with her friends than sitting drinking milk , which she is forced to do within the school .
So there are lots of reasons why this scheme might need to be looked at and we need to work with the schools , because average milk consumption in Ireland is low and we are worried about it in terms of the fight against obesity .
As I say , I look forward to the future and the health check .
My own health at the moment is a little bit dodgy and I think that a hot cup of milk for those of us who wait until this long hour would have been most welcome !
( PL ) Mr President , Mrs Jeggle 's reports make a start on the reform of the market for milk and milk products .
It is good that the proposal for and creation of a milk fund come before specific actions to reform the milk producers ' and processors ' sector .
It is also good that some flexibility is being introduced , with the reduction in the number of regulations affecting the EU organisation of the market for milk and milk products .
What is not good is that this flexibility did not go further and that milk quotas , i.e. hands-on control over production quantities , have not been abandoned .
It is also not good that standardisation in the form of the consolidation of protein and fat content has remained , since , unlike the situation with meat production , it separates the quality of the product from the producer .
Finally , on behalf of producers , processors and all of us , I hope that this reform achieves more of the objectives set for it than the last one .
( ES ) Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her reports which have gone into the Commission proposals in detail and improved them , and I only hope that the technical agreement reached in the special agriculture committee does not prevent the Council from considering the amendments adopted by Parliament , such as the amendment on the non-abolition of aid to private storage .
Furthermore I would like to stress that this package of proposals contains significant elements which herald the start of an intermediate stage leading to the abolition , in principle by the year 2015 , of the quota system .
I refer by way of illustration to decreasing the intervention price for skimmed milk powder .
The announcement that milk quotas are to disappear has by itself created a situation of uncertainty among producers , as the Commissioner is well aware , and the quota market has been crippled as a result , making for a significant slowdown in the restructuring required in the sector , at least in Spain .
On those grounds we are asking the Commission not to delay in presenting proposals on the future of the sector which reply to questions such as the rate of gradual increase in quotas or possible compensation for loss of production rights , or the level of direct aid following the new fall in intervention prices ; these questions among others require an urgent response so that the sector can be brought out of this uncertain situation .
( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , we are discussing the mini-package of reforms to the market for milk and milk products .
Mini-package is a good description for the proposed changes .
A full and proper reform of this market is yet to come .
The proposals contained in the mini-package are sensible and deserve support .
They are concerned with the creation of a milk fund that will support reforming activities in this sector , such as the promotion of milk consumption , including consumption in schools , or support for milk production in mountainous areas .
Support for private storage of milk products should also be maintained .
But there is a fundamental question : what about the major reforms of the milk market ?
We see at present that prices of milk products are increasing , which will fuel inflation throughout the European Union .
The requirement to export milk products from the EU is growing .
What is the situation within the EU ?
Production quotas and enormous fines for exceeding them .
What should be done ?
Acting in a systematic but controlled way we should start to increase milk quotas by 2 to 5 % per annum , depending on the situation in the country in question .
Let us pave the way for the abolition of quotas by 2015 - this is what farmers are waiting for .
The Commissioner has spoken about this on many occasions .
Can we afford to wait for the Health Check ?
I do not think so .
I believe we can start on the gradual process of increasing milk quotas from today .
I repeat : slowly , gradually , and in a fully monitored way .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Jeggle has done an outstanding job with the three reports on milk , for which I give her warm thanks .
I also thank the Commissioner for the proposals that form the basis of our discussion today .
These three reports are of a rather technical nature .
The crucial debate on milk will take place in connection with the Health Check .
I would like to address a few points .
I am pleased that the first report is concerned with standardising the protein content of milk powder , which leads to market adjustment .
In the second report , I find it welcome that the 27 national quality classes for butter are to be removed and replaced with a single , Europe-wide quality definition .
I am also glad that more attention is being paid to the question of school milk .
It is better to make milk and milk products tasty for our children than to have to discuss alcohol abuse among young people , as was the case today .
The third report indicates that drinking milk could be marketed more flexibly .
Here I would insist to the Commissioner that the + / - 0.2 % tolerance margin is far too high .
Milk producers calculate the fat content of the milk they get from the farmers exactly to within 0.01 % , so they must also be able to give consumers an exact indication of the fat content of drinking milk .
Milk is a valuable and healthy food .
Milk and milk products form part of a healthy diet and I hope the upward trend continues for our dairy farmers and that the market grows .
That is urgently necessary to ensure that our dairy farmers are rewarded better for working 365 days a year .
The outcry about rising milk prices is not justified .
Average consumption in Europe is 260 kg .
If the consumer has to pay 10 cents more , that comes to 50 cents a week and surely we should consider milk production in Europe worth that much .
( RO ) Mr President , dear colleagues , the measure of simplifying the common milk market is , also from the Member States ' perspective , a great initiative that brings the European Union closer to the farmers ' real needs .
This is possible especially by liberalizing production and milk marketing .
This is good news especially for those countries whose farmers should make too large investments to produce just one of the 3 milk categories accepted until now .
I do not think that under the present market conditions farmers could have adapted their production by 2009 , the end of the transition period .
Moreover , the European Union does not have to dictate the contents of milk products , as long as the phytosanitary standards are complied with .
That is why I totally agree with this liberalization measure .
Secondly , I support the introduction of one single rate of aid in the school-milk scheme .
This is an important measure that will contribute to social cohesion in Europe as poorer regions will be favoured , and to the fight against obesity among young people .
According to a Commission proposal , the aid should be higher because schools and kindergartens should not be forced to take part in financing a part of the cost .
Moreover , this amount will be an advantage especially for those states which already have an aid system in schools .
European funds can contribute to the quality of programmes and products provided to students and will remove significant budgetary resources of Member States , that could thus be used within the context of policies for young people .
I also support the creation of the European Fund for milk market restructuring .
It should also include a financing line for improving quality , according to which many farmers in the new Member States cannot sell their production any more after 2009 .
Least but not last , we have to see the changes in the common market organisation in the wider context of health control under the common agriculture policy .
I think that this is the right time for restructuring the common milk market with the aim of removing the milk-quota system .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking those of you who are still present for a constructive debate .
As there do not seem to be major differences in our opinion on the milk mini-package , I would take the opportunity to use my final comments on the ' elephant in the room ' .
In the last couple of weeks , various stakeholders and media have put particular focus on the development of dairy prices in the Community during the summer . I shall be more than happy to have this opportunity today to put things straight in order to avoid potential misunderstandings .
It is a fact that prices for dairy products have gone up substantially since the beginning of the year , in particular as a response to the market and , as rightly mentioned , not as a response to the increased production of bio-energy .
Of course , there are some explanations for the increase in these prices , and I would like to come back to this a little later , but first I shall just put things into a more general perspective .
We all know that the proportion of the income spent by European households on food has been going down gradually , year after year .
Today we are in a situation where the Community is spending only about 12 % on food and non-alcoholic beverages - a dramatic decrease , as you can see from the money spent .
It was very interesting to see that a German newspaper made a very quick study , concluding that in order to buy one litre of milk a person had to work for 11 minutes in 1960 and only 3 minutes in 2006 .
While the average price for butter today is EUR 4.10 , it was EUR 4.50 in 1982 .
These prices are nominal prices and do not take inflation into account .
The current prices are coming from a historical low level , which was established after the 2003 reform , which for the industry provided a stronger competitive basis and for the dairy farmers provided compensation for potentially lower prices .
Let me now come back to the fundamentals in the current market situation .
First , most subsidies have been suspended for some time and these are mainly the export refunds , the intervention buying , the various different disposal aids .
Secondly , we are in a situation today where intervention stocks are empty - with all the quantities sold out into the internal market .
Thirdly , the supply of butter has been reduced due to the lower production and empty intervention stocks .
Cheese production was a priority use for milk fat until recently , when the improved prices for butter have led the industry to expand butter production again .
Fourthly , although the cow 's milk collected this year is slightly higher than last year , it does not fully meet the increase in demand .
I could continue naming other fundamentals , but basically we are today witnessing the play of market forces based on supply and demand .
Gone is the pre-reform market attitude that the intervention level was the price leading .
The industry is now taking genuine commercial decisions , providing maximum return for further investments , while also allowing higher prices to be paid to the dairy producers - the farmers .
In that context , I am pleased to see the positive development of raw milk prices during the last few months : 15-20 % has been reported in some Member States .
However , we all know that the cost of production has been going up and milk production will only continue to expand if the profit margin can be maintained or even increased .
Therefore , I would take this opportunity to draw a somewhat positive conclusion .
In a historical perspective , the current wholesale and retail prices are not dramatically high .
The return from the market for the dairy industry and for the farmers is encouraging , and the public market support spending in this sector is now more or less reduced to actions with some social character .
We should not let our policy decisions be dictated by short-term developments within the dairy sector , and throughout the next 12 months we will have an excellent opportunity to discuss ways and means to make the dairy sector move forward in a sustainable way .
We all know that the milk-quota system is due to end by 31 March 2015 . As I have already mentioned , I will launch a debate in November on the ' Health Check ' , and following discussions - including here in Parliament - we will launch all the legal proposals during late spring 2008 , so we can hopefully agree on the legislation to take place from 2009 .
In this context , we will take the opportunity to discuss in a broader context the whole dairy sector .
I will examine which measures could be appropriate to try to find a soft landing for the expiry of the quota system in 2015 .
A soft landing could be , as has already been mentioned , some sort of an increase of the quotas before or in the mid-term up until 2015 .
I am quite sure that we will have a huge opportunity to have some very interesting discussions , including as regards the dairy sector in a broader context , throughout the next 12 months .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( SL ) Mr President , the European Commission 's proposal concerning a milk mini-package will definitely help to simplify the CAP and reduce the administrative burden .
Most of the sections in this package deserve support , particularly as regards allowing the production and marketing within the Community of milk for human consumption with more graduation of fat content then was previously possible , as well as the introduction of a single rate of subsidy for milk distributed under the ' school milk ' scheme .
However , the elimination of subsidies for the private storage of SMP and cream raises some questions .
The view of the European Commission is that EU operators did not use these support instruments for the milk market and , for this reason , they should be considered to be obsolete and unnecessary .
At present it is difficult to predict with any certainty the future of the market for milk and milk products over the longer term , especially as the Common Agricultural Policy is currently undergoing changes , and for this reason the elimination of the above support instruments , even though they are not currently being used , would appear to be somewhat rash .
in writing . - ( SV ) Many times in this Chamber the June List has had strong political objections to reports that have come from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
The report on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products is another report from that committee which stubbornly maintains continued protection of heavy subsidies for all the different groups in the agricultural sector and continued protectionism against the outside world .

Fight against terrorism ( debate )
The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions :
Mr President , could I ask that we do not start until the Council is here , because I find it quite strange that we have put oral questions to the Council , as well as the Commission , and are discussing this issue only with the Commission .
There is no point .
Could I ask that we stop whatever we are going to do until the Council is here to listen to us ?
If you will pardon my saying so , Mrs Buitenweg , I do not consider that appropriate , as we have no idea when the Council will arrive .
We may be waiting so long that we are unable to hold our debate at all .
In addition , the debate opens with speeches by the political group spokesmen .
I therefore propose that we make a start on these .
Does the House agree to this ?
( Parliament decided to start the debate )
Mr President , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the fight against terrorism is an area in which Europe has to switch from the virtual to the real .
The global dimension of terrorism calls for a global response .
Building a political Europe involves the ability to eradicate the scourge of terrorism ; we are still very wide of the mark .
Our group has taken the initiative of having this debate because we believe that Europe has not yet fully realised the extent of the dangers facing it .
The first , very immediate threat is the threat to our day-to-day security from Islamist and other terrorist groups , such as ETA in Spain .
We see it every day , Commissioner .
The second threat , just as worrying , is that these powerful networks could hijack the political culture of European democracies to undermine our essential values and replace them with their religious principles .
We need to make sure that our Member States cooperate more in the fight against international terrorism .
The resignation in March of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator , Mr de Vries , and the failure to replace him as yet , shows how much work there is still to be done .
It is true that Mr de Vries resigned for personal reasons , but it is well known that the inadequacy of the resources he was given meant that he was unable to complete the difficult task given to him .
We are asking the Council , which is not present , its President , and also the High Representative for the CFSP , Mr Solana , and the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , to fulfil their responsibilities and appoint a new EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator with adequate resources , as soon as possible .
Ladies and gentlemen , the fight against terrorist organisations requires the greatest firmness and cannot include negotiations or concessions .
Terrorist organisations are not the traditional centralised formations that can be overcome by conventional military operations .
They operate as networks , using the most sophisticated technologies to carry out their criminal operations .
It is only by continuing to pool substantial financial , human and intelligence resources that we will have a chance of neutralising those networks .
By respecting each other , guaranteeing the implementation of laws and public freedoms , reaffirming our idea of what it is to be human and of life in society , and acting together , we will put an end to a terrorism that , while using 21st century means , is inspired by prejudices and makes use of methods from humanity 's worst hours .
This is not , as people often say , a clash of civilisations but a confrontation between those who put respect for human beings and pluralism above everything , and those who , in the name of Jihad , would eliminate anyone who does not think like them or who holds other beliefs .
The victims of September 11 , whom we will be remembering in a few days ' time , five years after the tragic events in Manhattan , but also those of March 11 in Madrid and of the London bombings , impel us to take resolute action .
Europeans need security , security in their working lives , security in their supply of energy , and food security .
The least we can do for Europe , after guaranteeing peace , is to do all we can to guarantee the most basic security , personal security .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , many European instruments to fight terrorism have been introduced by Member States .
Yet a number of European countries are continuing to face a significant terrorist threat and it is therefore appropriate , after several years of those instruments being in force , to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of European legislation in this area .
Despite measures to encourage the national authorities responsible for fighting terrorism to share information , there is clearly a need for greater mutual trust .
To enable the fight against terrorism to be really effective , we do not need to add to existing legislation , but we do need to check that Member States are applying it correctly .
I think that we should be focusing particularly on genuinely improving cooperation between Member States .
An evaluation would also enable us to review the regulations concerned .
It seems necessary to me , in the process , to restore the balance between our fellow citizens ' need for security and the safeguarding of their right to protection of privacy .
Certain measures have been adopted that are very restrictive for our fellow citizens and we can see now , with the benefit of hindsight , that some of them have not had the results we anticipated and may , on the contrary , give a false impression of security .
The fight against terrorism also demands better cooperation between the European Union and its partners throughout the world .
In our transatlantic relations , for example , we should insist on drawing up a common strategy to fight terrorism , which respects fundamental rights and privacy .
The European Union should take a global approach to these issues in order to set the general principles for exchanging information with our US partners and for protecting data under these exchanges .
Finally , the European Parliament has often been kept out of the Council 's debates on terrorism .
I think it is important for us now to have a genuine debate leading to better democratic control by the European Parliament and by national parliaments .
Mr President , 2001-2007 has been six years of a politically motivated fight against terrorism .
The only thing we have seen in these six years is the quest for a policy response to every measure taken .
What I cannot make out , however , is an approach with regard to the development of European counter-terrorism policy in a global context .
What role are we playing ?
What role do we want to play worldwide ?
Do we have an underlying plan ?
To date , I have seen no plan or paper , either from the Commission or the Council - or , incidentally , from any Member State - proposing a short- , medium- and long-term counter-terrorism strategy .
We have launched measures with short-term effect , stemming financial flows - which has been excellent .
We have launched measures aiming to combat terrorism in the medium term by including biometric data in identity documents - which I , personally , do not consider to be the right approach , but was decided by a political majority .
With regard to the long term , I cannot see any progress or movement in the field of development assistance , which can be understood in the sense of security policy .
Nor do I see any movement in terms of respect for those cultures in which terrorism can supposedly originate ; that is , in terms of our making efforts to live a globalised existence , to coexist decently with each other in a globalised world , rather than going out and trying to communicate our society to the rest of the world .
The question , therefore , is : what role will Europe adopt ?
The response since 11 September 2001 has consisted of manifold actionism : each time there is an attack , the respective governments have endeavoured to reassure the population by launching short-term measures , be it the British vehemence in pushing through data retention in the immediate aftermath of the tragic attacks in London , or Germany 's endeavours to push through online searches .
There is a lack of an underlying plan .
Infringements of fundamental rights , as in the times of the emergency laws , will not solve the problem alone .
If we wish to combat terrorism successfully we must define Europe 's worldwide role in this fight , rather than pursuing national actionism , which is then carried out only in Europe .
Once there were terrorist groups in the various nations of the EU , there were internal problems , Europe was already largely united and there was already talk of a common strategy that never materialised .
We came to 2001 and learned that terrorism is a global phenomenon , that it is not a pyramid organisation but is formed of cells connected together mainly through the Internet and the best IT systems , with roots worldwide and able to strike how they want and when they want .
Despite this , there is no European Union policy for control of the Internet or to give definite security rules to citizens , who do not understand what measures have been adopted by the EU or are set to be adopted in the near future .
The most important measure is imposing responsibility on providers which host sites that promote , support or justify terrorist activities , for example through the mandatory barring of sites that can be traced directly or indirectly to persons who preach , incite or justify violence .
Switzerland has already been doing all this for a long time , while Europe is still hesitating and talking in vain .
There is no common position for monitoring sham religious meeting places or sham imams who , as also recently happened in the Netherlands and Italy , have used places that ought to have been devoted to prayers to sow hate , to plan attacks by inciting violence against the West , democracy , human rights , including women 's rights , actually launching terrorist attacks in our cities .
The arrests just now in Denmark of persons suspected of planning an attack using explosives , demonstrate that this is no time to lower our guard and that the anti-terrorism laws adopted by Denmark are working , but they also sound the alarm throughout the EU .
We can no longer allow ourselves to rely solely on the effectiveness of national laws and the efficiency of investigative forces from individual countries , but we need more coordination .
Too often , political correctness conceals an inability or reluctance to take decisions .
What is at risk is democracy , freedom and the right of individuals to live in peace and freedom .
Freedom is achieved through rules .
We must do what is politically right to safeguard not only our own peoples but also those throughout the world who respect their rights and are aware of their duties .
Any delay renders us complicit in wrongdoing .
Let us leave this debate with a joint undertaking to take immediate steps , not with supposed left-wing or right-wing positions , but strong and united .
That will be the best form of homage to the memory of the lives that from September 11 until today have throughout the world been cut short by atrocities .
May we each always consider terrorism a crime against humanity .
Mr President , my most important question to the Council is actually whether it considers itself fallible .
Is it conceivable that the Council makes mistakes from time to time , or is it all-knowing ?
Does the Council believe that all the measures taken in recent years in the fight against terrorism have been the right ones ?
Also , is it really beyond all doubt that no disproportionate infringement of civil rights has taken place ?
If the Council is infallible , it follows that there is no need for an evaluation , but if it believes in the possibility of improving its understanding , there is .
I should also like the Council to inform us during the course of the debate whether there are any particular measures it believes are missing , particular measures it now considers necessary that have not yet been taken .
Indeed , are any measures currently planned ?
Infringements of civil rights are permitted under European law , but are warranted only if they meet the criteria of necessity , proportionality and effectiveness and if people are able to arm themselves against abuses .
I should like to see an evaluation by the Council of all the measures taken over recent years , and also an examination of their compliance with these criteria .
Can the Council promise us this today ?
Allow me to highlight a few aspects that are in need of comprehensive evaluation .
First of all , the aspect of abuse : is it not conceivable that citizens could become unwitting victims ?
I should like to give as an example the creation of the lists of terror suspects .
The question in this regard is not only how people and organisations get included in these lists , but also how they get removed from them .
Supposing your name appears on these lists .
All your assets and bank deposits would be frozen , but the authorities would not automatically prosecute .
This means there would be no legal proceedings in which to present evidence .
The principle of innocent until proven guilty is abandoned .
Besides , I can quite imagine bank deposits being frozen before the fact is divulged , or the money would be on the other side of the world in a flash .
Yet I cannot imagine our accepting the fact of people remaining on lists and thus continuing to be punished without their guilt having been established .
This is an unacceptable inversion of the burden of proof in criminal law .
The Court of First Instance has already stated a number of times that the procedure must be amended .
On 11 July the Al-Aqsa Foundation and José María Sison were judged to have been listed wrongfully .
I should like to hear what lessons the Council has learned from these court rulings , and whether it is prepared to amend or evaluate the decision process regarding the composition of such lists , and also to look at opportunities for individuals to obtain justice .
Moving on to effectiveness : are the measures effective ?
I should like to take the measures on liquids as an example .
More than one million people in Europe are still having to fiddle about with plastic bags before boarding their flight , obediently filling them with 100 ml bottles - which often end up in the bin because passengers have forgotten the rule - and there is no excessive breach of civil rights and abuse can be monitored .
Is the measure effective , though ?
Is the Council prepared to assess this on the basis of scientific evidence ?
This brings me to the subject of proportionality .
Are the measures proportionate ?
This is another important aspect for evaluation .
Let me take passenger data and the agreement with the United States as an example .
My group , too , can fully appreciate countries ' desire to know who is entering their territory .
The main problem is not so much that excessive quantities of data are being requested , but that they can be requested for a great many different purposes .
The Council always justifies such a measure by saying that all this is necessary for the fight against terrorism .
However , the data can also be used for other purposes ' according to US law ' , as the agreement states .
Thus it is theoretically possible that the purpose is not only to combat terrorism , but also to tackle bicycle theft or bank fraud .
Is it proportionate to use the data for this ?
Is the Council prepared to review the agreement on these grounds , too ?
Finally , necessity .
I would take as an example the storage of traffic data for up to two years , which was opposed by my group but supported by the majority in this House .
All the information I have seen to date , however , shows that data up to three months old are the most effective and necessary .
Is the Council prepared to examine whether data stored for longer than three months are really being used ?
In short , is it prepared to carry out an evaluation based on the criteria of effectiveness , proportionality and necessity , and also to examine the possibility of combating abuse ?
The last aspect for evaluation is the Council 's position on breaches of human rights within the European Union , in connection with the CIA 's activities .
The European Parliament has investigated these as fully as possible , and it is scandalous , in my opinion , that we have never heard any comment from the Council .
This might consist of what it thinks about this , which aspects of the report it agrees with and which it does not , and what kind of measures it intends to take .
Is the Council prepared to give its reaction to the Fava report , or is it to persist in its silence ?
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are accustomed to declaring that combating terrorism is a priority and invoking new political legislative initiatives .
I believe that we ought first to assess the choices that have been made over the last few years and ask some questions .
Firstly : is terrorism stronger or weaker as a result of our legislative initiatives ?
Secondly : have we made a specific contribution to the development of our legal culture and our values , or have we betrayed them in the name of the terrorism crisis ?
I believe we should make it a priority to answer these two questions , and that if we did so we would discover that emergency measures have often been mistaken and that the lists of terrorist organisations have been imprecise , often dictated more by political motives than a real danger posed by the organisations .
We have appointed a person to coordinate counter-terrorism activities , and then we have found , without any clear reason , that we can do without the functions carried out by this person .
I therefore ask the Council not to appoint a new counter-terrorism coordinator because over the last few months we have discovered that we can easily do without one .
We have often said , and we say it firmly , and I think that we ought to say it again in this Chamber , that terrorism is the enemy of our civilisation , it is the enemy of the rule of democracy : terrorism is barbarity .
Terrorist attacks represent a move from the rule of law to a primitive state .
All this is true , but instead of focusing the debate on the reinstatement of the rules of democracy we have chosen to tackle the issue by restricting the rules of civil coexistence .
We have chosen to fight on our adversary 's home ground , to compete on violations of human rights , on military controls over the civilian population , on the negation of the key principles of democracy .
The images of Abu Ghraib or of the Guantanamo base are the symbol of the victory by the culture of terrorism over our rule of law and the key principles of our legal culture .
The other symbol is the CIA 's flights and abductions in Europe , with the explicit involvement of European governments .
There is an embarrassing silence about these events - as my fellow Members have done , I also call upon the Council to express itself on this point - there is an embarrassing silence , everyone has mentioned it !
This Parliament has spoken about the responsibilities of the CIA , the responsibilities of European governments , the responsibilities of our intelligence services .
The Commission has spoken and the Council of Europe is speaking about this .
The only embarrassing silence is from the European governments and I believe that this is unacceptable .
Let us hope that today the Council will state its view on this issue .
I believe that we should say emphatically that we have chosen an authoritarian distortion of the rule of law instead of choosing to safeguard the rule of law in order to combat terrorism .
It is not clear - and I am just finishing , Mr President - whether in the past few years European citizens have been put in more danger by terrorism or by the measures taken to combat terrorism .
An American feminist writer has said that when we are offered solutions by those responsible for our problems we should be on our guard .
I believe that we should be on our guard .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like first of all to apologise for arriving a little late at Parliament , purely and simply because I underestimated the traffic between the hotel and Parliament .
I should like also to greet Commissioner Frattini , who is here with us , and to try to reply to the questions put by Members ; I hope to provide all the clarifications we were asked to give .
There is no doubt that recent events in London and Glasgow , as well as on the border between Spain and Portugal plus the attack in Yemen , have confirmed that terrorism represents a considerable threat to Europe 's security and to the values of our democratic societies , particularly to the rights and freedoms of European citizens .
We are in no doubt that Member States must therefore continue to cooperate on strengthening and implementing counter-terrorism measures , while always respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms , which are core values in our societies and their protection and promotion will help prevent terrorism .
Terrorism must be fought at both national and international levels .
International cooperation is an essential tool for an effective fight against this scourge , at both national and multilateral levels .
We know that terrorism represents a global threat and therefore needs a global concerted response , which will necessarily include increasing the flow and exchange of information , internal coordination of positions , coordination / partnerships with third countries , the implementation of a global counter-terrorism strategy with the United Nations playing a leading role , and close collaboration with various regional and international organisations involved in combating terrorism .
Action by the European Union has intensified since 11 September 2001 and , subsequently , since the dreadful attacks in Madrid in 2004 and in London in 2005 .
In December 2005 the Council adopted the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy , under which the Union commits itself to combat terrorism globally while respecting human rights , allowing its citizens to live in an area of freedom , security and justice .
The EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy covers four strands of work : prevention , protection , pursuit and response .
The Presidency confirms that the Council does in fact carry out a six-monthly review of the situation as regards implementation of the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy and of the strategy against terrorist financing and an annual evaluation of the implementation of the Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism .
The Council also reviews the Action Plan to Combat Terrorism every six months and the Action Plan on Radicalisation and Recruitment on an annual basis .
This monitoring process enables the Council to pinpoint which of the measures proposed at EU level have not been adopted , or have not been duly implemented at Member State level .
It also gives the Council an opportunity to take certain policies further .
For example , the Presidency decided to speed up work in the field of explosives .
The adoption of certain measures in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has been slowed down by the need for unanimous decision-making in this field .
The adoption and implementation of counter-terrorism measures will be speeded up by the ratification of the Treaty to be approved by the Intergovernmental Conference , on the basis of the mandate adopted by the European Council at its last meeting in June .
As regards the need for closer cooperation between the law enforcement and security information services , Member State security services are currently working in close and very efficient collaboration within the Counter-Terrorism Group .
Europol has developed very effective analysis files that are increasingly supplied with information by Member State law enforcement services .
There is no doubt that more needs to be done .
The European Parliament maintains a close direct political dialogue with the Council and the Commission .
On 16 May 2007 the President of the Council , the Vice-President of the Commission and the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs met to examine the various counter-terrorism policies and to take stock of the implementation of the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy .
These six-monthly meetings are extremely useful for reaching a consensus on the policies to be developed in the field of combating terrorism .
As regards the position of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator , the Secretary-General / High Representative informed Member States that he was considering , in close collaboration with the Presidency , how best to coordinate work in the field of counter-terrorism within the Council .
As regards the relation between the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and the Situation Centre , SitCen takes no part in the drawing up of EU counter-terrorism policy or in the coordination of work in the field of counter-terrorism carried out by the Council ; nor does it monitor follow-up to the Council 's decisions .
In the field of combating terrorism its competence is limited to presenting to the Council strategic assessments of terrorist threats on the basis of information received from the national services .
It also supports the EU emergency and crisis coordination arrangements which may be implemented in order to help coordinate an EU level response to serious crises , which would potentially include terrorist attacks .
That is a mechanical function which includes disseminating information , providing meeting facilities and supporting the institutions ' existing decision-making arrangements .
It is not a coordinating role .
Nevertheless , it was on the basis of a threat assessment drawn up by SitCen that Council approved policy recommendations in various fields , such as the field of explosives , to prevent illegal use by terrorists .
The Presidency has no doubt that its efforts in the fight against terrorism are supported by European citizens who , moreover , at the time of the most recent attacks , amply demonstrated not only their solidarity with the victims of those attacks , but also their desire for an EU response to be developed .
In the drawing up of such a counter-terrorism strategy the Presidency has the support of its partners who bring their ideas to the high-level discussions , and the European Parliament , in particular , plays a vital role .
Compliance with the provision in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union is of paramount importance for the Council , as indeed is compliance with all the other articles of the Treaties .
Cooperation and dialogue with third countries are the mainstays of the EU Counter-Terrorism strategy .
In this half year alone there are plans for three-party style dialogue with Russia , the United States of America , Algeria and Morocco , which reflects the interest in broadening the dialogue with those countries .
The European Union also maintains anti-terrorism dialogue with other countries and international organisations .
Then , as regards our Mediterranean partners , we shall be holding our customary ad hoc Euromed experts ' meeting on terrorism , which will provide the opportunity to have wider discussions with our Mediterranean partners on a matter of vital interest in that region , and which will focus upon the implementation of priority areas of the Euro-Mediterranean Code of Conduct on Countering Terrorism .
The Portuguese Presidency is to organise , in conjunction with the United States , a workshop on the application of financial sanctions for combating terrorism .
The question of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism has also been broached by both parties on various occasions and the Presidency considers that it is very important to continue that dialogue which it regards as crucial for both sides .
In conclusion on this point , I would mention that strengthening the area of freedom , security and justice based on the Hague programme and the relevant plan of action , is one of the main priorities of the joint 18-month programme of the German , Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies .
The fight against terrorism is one of the great challenges in that area ; the three Presidencies included among their aims greater cooperation to combat terrorism by means of implementing the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy .
With your permission now , Mr President , I should like to reply to Oral Question .
I should like also to inform the House that the Council of the European Union makes a periodic review , as I mentioned , of the fight against terrorism and we also make an annual review of the Strategy and of the Action Plan for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism ; then every six months we review the strategy to combat terrorist financing .
The Council will shortly be presenting , for the first time , a report on the implementation of the communication strategy intended for the media and approved in July 2006 .
Under the terms of the Counter-Terrorism Strategy a high-level counter-terrorism meeting must be held once per Presidency between the Council , the Commission and the European Parliament .
Such meetings were held under the Austrian and German Presidencies .
The role of the national parliaments will be strengthened under the new Treaty currently under discussion within the Intergovernmental Conference .
The major priority is the implementation of measures already in existence .
The Council employs various mechanisms for assessment , such the EU 's peer evaluation process for national counter-terrorism measures , assessment of the implementation of the European Arrest Warrant , assessment of information exchange between Europol and the Member States and between Member States , etc .
New measures are already being analysed , such as the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection or measures concerning the bio-preparation technology programme , etc .
The Council has organised the assessment of information exchange between Europol and the Member States and between Member States .
The Secretary-General , Javier Solana , is considering how the function could best be fulfilled within the Secretariat General .
The mandate and brief of the possible new coordinator are also under consideration .
Like all the Institutions , the Council is committed to the provision contained in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union which states that the Union is based on the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the rule of law .
The promotion of those values is one of the EU 's priorities .
The Member States ' commitment to respect fundamental rights is also enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
Moreover , the Member States of the European Union , as members of the Council of Europe , are bound by the obligations arising from the European Convention on Human Rights .
The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights strengthens the EU 's capacity to monitor and collect information , thus promoting maximum respect for fundamental rights .
EU Member States must ensure that the measures they adopt to combat terrorism are consistent with their obligations under international law , especially international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law .
The Presidency considers that the fight against terrorism should be conducted in a manner which respects human rights given that the rule of law , good governance and the protection of fundamental freedoms are tools in the fight against terrorism .
That principle is central to the Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the Council , as you know , in December 2005 .
Turning now to the Judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 12 December 2006 to which the question refers .
First I should like to mention that the Judgment in Case T-228 / 02 of 12 December 2006 , known as the OMPI Case ( Organisation des Modjahedines du Peuple d 'Iran v Council of the European Union ) , does not justify the conclusion that the EU practice of terrorist lists is in breach of EU legislation .
The Court did not in fact rule against the practice of terrorist lists , but considered merely that some fundamental rights and guarantees , including the right of defence , the obligation to state reasons and the right to effective judicial protection are , in principle , fully applicable in the context of the adoption of a Community decision to freeze funds in accordance with Regulation ( EC ) No 2580 / 2001 .
Secondly , it is public knowledge that the Council already systematically undertook the necessary revision of its procedures with respect to the list of persons and entities to which Regulation ( EC ) No 2580 / 2001 applies .
The Council also decided to create a new working party - the Working Party on Common Position 931 - which is to deal with requests for inclusions on or exclusions from the list and to prepare for the Council 's regular review of the list .
The mandate , practical arrangements and the working methods of this new working party are contained in a public document adopted by the Council .
All those on the list to which Regulation ( EC ) No 2580 / 2001 applies are treated in the same way , as may be seen from the previous answer .
The role and competences of the institutions are laid down in the Treaties .
The Council takes the necessary measures required to implement the judgments of the Court of Justice in accordance with the provisions of Article 233 of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
As regards Parliamentary control over its decisions , the Council always follows the procedures laid down in the Treaties .
It is important to mention that the European Parliament , in accordance with Article 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , was consulted when Regulation ( EC ) No 2580 / 2001 was adopted .
Thank you very much for your attention .
( Applause )
All sources indicate that the threat of new terrorist attacks continues to be high .
Our Member States ' authorities have been able to prevent a number of attacks , for which we must be very grateful .
I am talking about Spain , Italy , Belgium , the UK and Germany .
Yesterday the Danish authorities dismantled a group of young terrorists , also of Danish nationality , ready to mount a bombing attack .
Minister Espersen said it was the most serious terrorist case in Denmark .
This morning , we learn that suspected terrorists have been arrested in Frankfurt , and the German Minister of Defence said an attack was imminent .
Do you believe that in all these cases no results have been achieved ?
Do you not believe that stopping the final stage of a terrorist attack is not in itself a fantastic result for Europe ?
My answer is - yes , it is .
( Applause )
So there is no room for complacency or letting our guard down .
I would first of all like to take this very good opportunity to inform you of a package of measures which are in preparation by my services , and which will be adopted by the Commission this autumn in very close cooperation with the Portuguese Presidency .
We are working on prevention and prosecution .
This package will consist of a European action plan on the security of explosives , a proposal for an amendment of the Framework Decision on terrorism to deal with terrorist misuse of internet , and a proposal on European passenger name record ( PNR ) policy .
In addition , the package will contain a report on evaluation of the implementation by the Member States of the Framework Decision on terrorism .
A few words on each of these elements :
The European action plan on explosives is a follow-up to the 2005 Commission communication on this topic , and aims to respond to repeated calls from the European Council and the Council of Ministers of the Interior to improve the explosives situation in Europe .
You will no doubt recall that the attacks in Madrid were committed using commercially available explosives and detonators , which prompted the call for EU action in this area .
I am glad that I can report to you that a lot of good work has been done by our services together with a wide range of stakeholders , including representatives of the private sector .
I have received what I think will prove to be a ground-breaking report from a public-private expert group that I have established , which contains around 50 valuable concrete recommendations to improve security of explosives , precursors and detonators across the EU .
These recommendations will form the basis for the European action plan which should be adopted , as I said , before November .
The measures that will be proposed in it include , for example , the setting-up of a European explosives database at Europol with links to all the responsible services in Member States , in addition to an early warning system so that these services are informed very quickly , for example , when explosives have been stolen or a new terrorist modus operandi is discovered from credible intelligence information .
This brings me to the internet and the way this tool , which has brought amazing advantages to our world , is being misused by terrorists .
We all know that terrorists enjoy the benefits of the internet just as much as ordinary citizens , for instance to plan their attacks or to disseminate messages of concrete incitement to commit terrorist attacks .
The benefits of e-learning have also not escaped the attention of terrorists .
You can find on internet websites , for example , detailed information and instructions of all kinds of terrorist tactics , including the production of explosives .
The proposal I mentioned just now will aim at ensuring that these forms of negative and criminal behaviour will be made punishable across the EU .
Another element of this package of measures relates to the idea of having a European policy on PNR .
Reflection on details of this proposal is still ongoing , but the Commission 's main intention is to ensure that each Member State collects PNR records , processes them and , where appropriate , exchanges them with others .
Up until now , PNR has been associated mostly with negotiation aimed at ensuring that European citizen data are processed correctly by our partners and allies , in particular the United States .
I think the time has come to partially change focus and devote resources to the security of the European Union .
The Union is at least as much a potential target of a terrorist attack as the United States and the use and analysis of PNR is an important law enforcement tool to protect our citizens , who deserve the same protection as the citizens of the United States .
The final element of the package consists of the second report on the implementation of the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism .
The new report will also include information on the situation in the new Member States , which was not available in 2004 - and you can understand why .
This brings me to the more general question raised concerning an overall comprehensive evaluation of all counter-terrorist measures adopted until now .
Of course , I am in favour of the principle of evaluating the effectiveness of policies .
As regards justice , freedom and security policies in particular you might be aware that work is ongoing on the development of global evaluation mechanisms .
I am ready to cooperate , as I have been doing in the past with Parliament , and in particular with the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , to carry out the evaluation of the existing measures , including the international and European agreements with our international partners .
But let me make it clear that my aim is to strengthen , not to weaken , our ability to prevent and prosecute terrorism in a more effective way .
As regards the exchange of information between Member States and European institutions , I fully agree that this is an essential aspect of the fight against terrorism .
As you know , I have been active in this area .
Over the past years , I have put forward a number of proposals on data protection in the third pillar , on the principle of availability and on data retention of electronic communications .
Unfortunately , except for data retention , it has not yet been possible to reach agreement on these proposals in the Council , particularly on data protection in the third pillar .
But I will continue to strive for their adoption and with the Portuguese proposal we have an agreement in principle to try to get a final adoption of the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar by December .
It is very often said that mutual trust is needed for effective cooperation , especially when combating terrorism .
My view is that trust can be stimulated by us mainly in two ways .
First , through ensuring that there is a clear and proper legal framework in place that provides confidence that information supplied will be treated in an appropriate manner and , secondly , through stimulating as many shared international experiences as possible , including joint training exercises so that people working in the field get to know and appreciate each other .
Concerning the Situation Centre ( ' SitCen ' ) , I should mention that it has certainly provided the Council with a valuable strategic analysis of the terrorist threat , and I have established , thanks to cooperation with Mr Solana , a very good practical cooperation on this .
Nevertheless , I do not see a role for SitCen in the area of operational cooperation , certainly not as a coordinating tool for investigations , since its mandate is limited to dealing with non-personal information .
This is rather a task for Europol and Eurojust .
I believe these are organisations that should be better equipped to deal with such tasks .
We should not forget that the large majority of our citizens - 84 % in the latest Eurobarometer - are strongly in favour of EU action to combat terrorists and organised crime .
So , let us strengthen Europol and Eurojust based on that .
Naturally , any action we take must be in line with the fundamental rights acquis and with Article 6 of the Treaty .
I intend to submit to the Member States a questionnaire on anti-terrorist measures they have adopted , on their effectiveness and on how these relate to the human rights framework .
I am ready to share with you data and results of this exercise .
In conclusion , I believe that our counter-terrorist efforts clearly require joint action and the total dedication of the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
I am ready to respond once again positively to further possible invitations from this Parliament and from the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , as I have been doing since my appointment at the Commission .
( Applause )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , speaking earlier , Mr Catania said that the European public was afraid that the rule of law was disintegrating .
The European public reads in today 's newspapers of the arrest of terrorists in Denmark who had made definite plans for attacks .
The German public awoke today to the news that three terrorists had been planning an attack on Frankfurt am Main airport .
The public is afraid .
It is worried .
Terrorism in Europe has caused deaths and a great deal of suffering .
The public expects to be safe .
Tackling this is our task as European politicians .
What is the European response ?
Hearing the President-in-Office of the Council today , I realised that stagnation and paralysis have taken hold here .
I am disappointed .
As we know , terrorism is networked across Europe .
The cells cooperate by means of the Internet and using various methods .
The Ministers of the Interior are doing their own thing at national level and believing that they have things under control .
I , too , am in favour of an evaluation and of our now putting to the test the measures we have implemented , but we also need new momentum .
Terrorism has not been defeated .
We need a fresh start .
That is why the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the Commission 's initiatives .
Terrorism is directed at our way of life , and therefore I should like to emphasise that combating it is a cultural challenge .
For example , Europe stands for gender equality , so we want no forced marriages in Europe .
Anyone forcing young girls into marriage must be punished .
Europe stands for tolerance , and so we want no preachers of hate , with their condemnation of other religions .
I am in favour of expelling such people from Europe .
I would say to all preachers : no god approves of murder .
I would ask that today 's debate be used to give backing to the Council and , in particular , to our Commission , which has put forward good proposals , so as to generate new momentum .
Mr President , I believe it is important to hold this debate today .
It is also important for Parliament to ask questions about progress in the cooperation between Member States in a high-priority area , the fight against terrorism .
There are some doubts about whether that cooperation is always satisfactory , and whether the Council 's response to the threat that has been described many times today is always adequate .
A lack of urgency has become apparent with regard to the Council 's progress on a number of points .
Also important in this regard is the issue of the successor to Gijs de Vries in the post of Counter-Terrorism Coordinator , which has lain vacant for some months now .
The question also remains as to what has happened to the Council 's response to the Fava report , Parliament 's comprehensive report on the CIA and certain practices that have been used in the fight against terrorism .
Cooperation is not always as it should be , in spite of - I must reiterate this - the tremendous commitment of Commissioner Frattini , who has just given a further demonstration of his vigorous approach .
Naturally , however , what he wants and is able to do is ultimately determined to some extent by what the Council makes possible .
Today I should like to call attention to one important aspect in particular , one alluded to by both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office , and that is radicalisation and recruitment .
We must seek the best way to combat radicalisation - be it religiously motivated or of right-wing extremist origin - at European level , too , in the form of cooperation between Member States .
It is important in this regard to find ways of reaching out to young people who are susceptible to this kind of radicalisation .
That is one of the priorities of the Council and the Commission , and Parliament , too , will be discussing the subject further in the near future .
We must try to discover the motives of the young people who , as a result of radicalisation , are sometimes enticed to engage in terrorist activities .
These motives include dissatisfaction with their own situation , discontent with what is happening in international politics or with the polarisation of their own society , a need for meaning , and frustration with world politics .
Poverty can also be a motive .
We must examine all these motives if we wish to achieve an effective approach .
The motives of young people in Morocco who have carried out attacks are often completely different from the motives of those who have done so in the Netherlands , for example the man who murdered Theo van Gogh .
We must join together to seek arguments capable of combating radicalisation , and improve circumstances so that young people are not so readily susceptible to incitement to radicalisation and violence .
Keeping numbers of radicalised young people down is an initial challenge .
An appropriate policy here is one of repression : tackling those who incite others to violence , tackling virtual Internet networks that incite young people to extreme behaviour , and also containing groups via a preventive policy .
This begins at local level , but can also be translated to national and European level .
I should like to draw attention in this regard to the new initiatives announced by the Dutch Government , for which a substantial amount of money has also been earmarked .
This is to be used at local level , in the neighbourhoods , to find an approach to identifying young people who may be susceptible to radicalisation and everything that can result from this .
I should like to recommend that the Commission focuses on the experience of the Netherlands , on how this can be exchanged with other Member States .
It may also be possible to use the Commission 's Integration Fund to promote some of these activities , to bring the added value of a European approach to bear in this field , too .
I should like to ask the Commissioner once more whether he , too , can envisage any possibilities for exchanging Dutch practice with other Member States who are facing the same problems , particularly in large towns and cities .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , if we go back just over 2 000 years , we will recall that in the autumn of 68 bc the world 's only superpower suffered a terrorist attack by a band of loosely organised pirates , and in panic the Roman Senate granted Pompey , at least according to Plutarch , ' absolute authority and uncontrolled power over everyone ' through the Lex Gabinia .
By the oldest trick in the book , the military subverted liberty , democracy and the constitution with the assent of Rome 's frightened citizens , and it took 1 800 years for mature democracy to resurface in Europe .
Now , once again , laws that take away our freedoms risk entering by the back door .
I welcome the oral questions that colleagues have tabled today , with their very specific questions to Council and Commission .
I do not argue that counter-terrorism laws are unnecessary .
The arrest yesterday of three people in Germany and the arrest this morning of another three in Denmark show the continuing threat that terrorists pose to our society .
My Group is united in its belief that we need more judicial cooperation to make Europol and Eurojust as effective as possible .
We backed the European Arrest Warrant to the hilt , trusting the Council to put minimum procedural guarantees in place .
We would support a European FBI .
Liberals and Democrats are not soft on crime .
Indeed , we are astonished at the failure of Europe 's right-wing-dominated Council to find a coherent approach to a matter of law and order .
What we are saying , however , is that laws must be proportionate to threats .
And indeed , if the threat is so great , why has the Council not moved to replace its anti-terrorism coordinator since the last one left in March ?
Mr President-in-Office , you have told us that you are ' reflecting on the best way of ensuring cooperation ' .
Well , the terrorists have had six months while you have been reflecting .
You tell us that ' the United States has the leading role in counter-terrorism ' .
We want the European Union to set its own policy .
You tell us that the European Parliament has , and I quote , ' a primordial role ' , but that primordial role turns out to be a courtesy meeting once every six months with the chairman of our committee .
I welcome Commissioner Frattini 's agreement today to evaluate with Parliament the effectiveness of European Union policy , and I hope the Council Presidency will come along with him for that debate .
Since 9 / 11 , we have had a counter-terrorism strategy , an action plan , a framework decision and several cooperation initiatives .
None of these has been thoroughly and openly evaluated , let alone by Europe 's democratic institutions .
The Council and the Commission should involve Parliament in a comprehensive review of all the measures adopted thus far .
Here in Parliament , we should be insisting on sunset clauses for anti-terror laws so that legislation susceptible to abuse does not remain on the statute books any longer than necessary .
We are now on to the third and final PNR agreement , for example , an agreement which in perpetuity gives up certain rights for uncertain benefits .
My Group questions whether security really demands that the United States Government knows our dietary preferences .
Commissioner Frattini , you tell us that 85 % of citizens are strongly in favour of European action .
Mr Lobo Antunes , you tell us that the Presidency has no doubt that its measures are supported by citizens .
Have the two of you not passed through an airport this summer ?
Have you not heard the young women asking why their lipstick has to be confiscated before they board an aeroplane ?
Have you not heard the old ladies cry out in frustration when their toenail scissors are taken away ?
Have you not listened to the people infuriated at how anti-terror laws are being exploited for commercial gain ?
My local airport now charges people 50 pence for a plastic bag into which travellers have to put their toothpaste .
Constituents have written to me about how much is being charged for bottled water air-side of the security controls .
The Lex Gabinia was a classic illustration of the law of unintended consequences because it fatally subverted the institutions it was supposed to protect .
I hope that Europe 's anti-terror laws will not end up doing the same .
Karl Popper once said , ' We must plan for freedom , and not only for security , if for no other reason than only freedom can make security secure ' .
( Applause )
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , in the wake of the tragic experiences of New York , Madrid and London , our ability to cooperate in counter-terrorism matters has grown , in both EU and transatlantic contexts .
We should take further steps in this direction .
Our concern for privacy and citizens ' rights should not be used to justify the blocking of effective action .
There is an unavoidable price to pay for safety in this area .
What our citizens are looking for above all is safety .
Changes to international law are also needed .
Modern terrorism has given rise to a hitherto unknown phenomenon - that of the stateless soldier .
His statelessness makes it difficult to apply the Geneva Conventions .
At the same time we must agree that it makes no sense to afford terrorists the procedural rights characteristic of the European penal process , and that it deprives us of effectiveness in combating this phenomenon .
Mr President , today we received news of the arrest of suspected terrorists in Denmark and Germany that has been mentioned many times .
This demonstrates that the problem in question is not theoretical , but real .
This being the case , the motto ' the more , the better ' cannot be the order of the day ; instead , we need targeted measures that are coordinated throughout Europe and , above all , prove to be worthwhile in practice and to indeed be helpful .
This brings me to my first point , namely the urgent need for an overview of the measures that have been taken to date by the nation states .
I welcome the Commissioner 's announcement that a questionnaire is to be drawn up .
We need this evaluation , precisely because we wish to convince our citizens of the necessity of counter-terrorism measures .
However , to do so , we must prove that they are indeed effective .
After all , we wish to know what has been achieved to date in the fight against terrorism .
In this connection , we are also interested in the regrettable refusal to take a position on the illegal kidnappings in Europe by the CIA thus far .
We need answers on this score , too .
I should like to make one thing clear : secret prisons and extraditions to third countries where torture is carried out are also connected with the fight against terrorism , namely its moral dimension .
The moral dimension of the fight against terrorism must not be neglected , as we must prevail there , too , if we want to succeed .
Some speakers have mentioned the importance of involving the European Parliament in this debate .
I believe that the Council Presidency needs to understand that the involvement of freely elected people 's representatives is indispensable for the purposes of acceptance .
I should like the Council Presidency to strengthen this aspect of the discussion .
As the President-in-Office knows , the European Court of Justice has decided repeatedly that the EU list of terrorist organisations infringes both Community and international law .
I welcome his comments on this issue today .
I am also interested to hear , however , whether the annual evaluations of which he spoke are to be made available to Parliament and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
After all , we need these for our work , to enable us to really assess what happens with this ' terror list ' , the extent to which the rule of law and parliamentary control are ensured , and to what extent it can be guaranteed that those appearing wrongfully on this list will be removed from it as soon as possible .
The issue of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator has already been raised .
We want to know the future plans for this post .
My group is not against such European coordination in principle .
It makes sense in theory to consolidate competences in this field , to endeavour to bring together the experiences gathered at national level .
We are also interested to hear , however , what the Council Presidency has to say about the work done to date by the counter-terrorism unit at European level .
What kind of experiences have there been with it ?
Hence my question to the President-in-Office : what lessons have you learned from the work done to date by Mr de Vries ?
Mr President , in my opinion , this debate is fairly fundamental to democracy in the European Union .
It is good to take a look back .
Since 12 September 2001 , a ' war ' has been waged on terrorism .
On that day , NATO invoked the mutual defence clause , having wrongly judged the attacks in New York and Washington to be military attacks .
How this mutual defence clause can be revoked is anyone 's guess .
Now the ' war on terror ' is being waged worldwide , for example in Afghanistan , where Iraqisation is increasing progressively , whilst at domestic level more and more fundamental and civil rights are being invalidated . The whole situation could be described as a permanent state of emergency .
The EU has adopted a framework decision on combating terrorism .
This sets out a large number of points being implemented or to be implemented by the EU Member States and the EU itself .
We are currently seeing widespread ' actionism ' , especially by the German Minister of the Interior , Wolfgang Schäuble , who is now describing everything as terrorism and is clearly overstepping the bounds of what is actually necessary .
After London , the author A.L. Kennedy made a very interesting comment , which I should like to quote here : ' Nobody mentions that the number of victims , as horrendous as it was , would be considered only moderate in Baghdad on most days .
Nobody says that , in deciding to send our soldiers to war for profit , Tony Blair also put his country in danger [ ... ]
Nobody mentions that our actions have only increased the number and the intensity of terrorist acts .
Nobody notes that even we have justified the torturing of prisoners by saying that attacks could be prevented by this means .
Nobody mentions that , for vast parts of the world , we are the terrorists . '
That is exactly what must be avoided , which is why the invalidation of fundamental and civil rights cannot continue .
Mr President , I should like to start by thanking the President-in-Office of the Council and the Vice-President of the European Commission sincerely for their detailed replies to our questions .
I am pleased that this debate gives us the opportunity to look back in order to move forward again .
At the forefront of this debate is the question of what measures have been taken to combat terrorism and whether these have been effective .
More important still is the question of whether the measures conflict with the democratic rule of law .
Today , we are to vote on amending the rules on hand luggage in air transport .
Mr Watson has already spoken about this .
This vote - I hope - will put an end to a controversial measure .
The rules on liquids are ineffective and arouse great opposition .
We must ensure that the fight against terrorism does not become a policy of delusion .
An enormous amount of information has been gathered since the 2001 attacks - yet data collection must lead to data processing .
After the attacks in London and Madrid it emerged that the intelligence services did indeed have data at their disposal but did not act in time .
The data may be available , but application remains a problem .
Recently , a book was published in the Netherlands about terrorism and those combating it .
This argues from a historical perspective that the effectiveness of terrorism is limited .
The fight against terrorism , on the other hand , sometimes has a major impact on society , resulting in irritation .
Those combating terrorism lose their moral credit balance with citizens in the course of this battle - which is a gain for the terrorists .
When we take new measures , therefore , we must strike the right balance between the rule of law and an effective fight against terrorism .
Monitoring is a legitimate parliamentary instrument in this regard .
The former Counter-Terrorism Coordinator , Gijs de Vries , said that in his experience not one Member State wanted a European police force or a European security service .
Member States want security to continue to be organised at national level .
Yet we are still trying to organise European cooperation .
One problem that follows from this is the lack of democratic control of such cooperation .
National parliaments monitor their own services , but not this cooperation .
What does the Council think about informing the European Parliament consistently and regularly ?
By this I do not mean primarily presenting new measures for approval , but answering the questions that have now been raised so often .
As is the case with the national parliamentary security committees , such meetings should be allowed to take place behind closed doors .
I should like to hear whether the Council wishes to cooperate on this .
Mr President , the latest reports from Denmark and Frankfurt am Main in Germany are proof that the threat of Islamist terrorism has not gone away .
Yet the most recent studies demonstrate that this threat comes less from outside - that is , from Al-Qaida - than from young Muslims living in the European Union itself who are susceptible to radicalisation and subsequently turn into terrorists .
Terrorists do not just appear out of the blue , therefore ; potential perpetrators grow up in our Islamist parallel societies , with madrasahs and preachers of hate , in particular , playing a major , a disastrous , role .
Thanks to political correctness , the indigenous peoples of Europe are all too easily labelled right-wing extremist or even racist for insisting on their basic culture , whilst migrants seldom face this problem .
The Islamist parallel societies now existing throughout Europe are often underestimated .
Terrorism often has its roots in schools .
It then continues in juvenile gangs and , following this radicalisation , may then culminate in attacks .
We must close the gaps in our society in which terrorism can thrive , gaps that have arisen from misplaced tolerance .
We must draw boundaries ; there is certainly no need for us to tolerate everything .
Changing our traditional lifestyles and denying our own culture provides the best breeding ground for terrorism .
It is high time , therefore , that Brussels , too , accepted that the multicultural vision is in tatters and supported Europe 's indigenous population again at long last , instead of constantly discrediting it under the pretext of stamping out racism .
Mr President , there are essentially two points I would like to make in this important debate .
First , all or most of us can come to this House and deplore and denounce terrorism , as well we might , because it is vile and indefensible in all its forms .
But within the EU do we always consistently practise what we preach ?
Events at Frankfurt and in Denmark are a reminder of the ever-present threat of terrorism .
If any government minister anywhere in the EU were to condemn those arrests this morning or later to resist connected necessary extraditions , we would all be outraged because terrorism is terrorism and is not sanitised by the passage of time .
Yet in my small country just weeks ago we had the Deputy First Minister , Martin McGuinness , who knows more than most about the hideous practice of terrorism , reverting to form and vehemently attacking the German Government 's current application , under a European arrest warrant , for the extradition of an Irish Republican suspect for a bombing many years ago in Germany .
Such behaviour is intolerable .
Just as was the harbouring by Ireland of three IRA terrorists convicted in Colombia .
So I say it behoves us all in Europe to lead by example .
We cannot pick and choose in attacking and resisting terrorism .
If we are against it , we must be against it all and act accordingly .
If you genuinely support the rule of law , then you do not attack and protest against the means of securing international justice .
My second point is that the recourse of ETA to active terrorism is a timely reminder that seldom does the terrorist leopard change its spots .
Those who stoop to terrorism have an amoral mindset , capable of switching for tactical reasons to supposed commitment to political means if , for the time being , it better serves their purposes .
We should all be wary of such and never make the mistake of judging terrorists by our own standards .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to start by saying that the fight is not against the phenomenon of terrorism .
In each case the fight is against a particular organisation that has a particular political agenda and specific political objectives .
We therefore need to start by naming the terrorist organisation that we are faced with , and at the moment , the fundamental future risk facing the European Union is a jihadist terrorist organisation , which is not a phenomenon but rather an organisation that has already overcome the fear of carrying out attacks on our continent .
The difference between this organisation and other traditional organisations that have struck at and are striking at the European Union , is that it is still very much an unknown quantity , because we do not understand the rhythm of attacks or the reason behind the choice of countries , and because their sense of timing is significantly different from ours .
Because of this , as Mr Watson expressed so well , the task of the EU 's institutions is not to produce an exhaustive list of measures , but rather it is time to establish the foundations , the pillars and even the fields of operation for the European institutions to play a role in the fight against terrorism .
We need to seek direction .
In this area it is not about announcing more and more measures .
We have to understand that the role of the EU 's institutions should be establishing what we fundamentally need in order to fight this organisation , which is intelligence and information .
Therefore , first and foremost we need a European model for fighting this terrorist organisation , because otherwise , in the Europe of 2025 , if the European Union does not add value , if it is no good and is neither useful nor recognised as serving Europeans in this fight against terrorism , they will wonder what the point of the European Union is .
( ES ) Mr President , I do think that it has been repeated ad nauseam that the phenomenon of terrorism - which is , of course , clearly recognisable groups - is not only a European issue , it is a global issue , as the Council said , and there is no doubt that we need global and European responses .
I believe , and in view of what Mr Frattini said about what happened this morning in Frankfurt , which I also heard about , that it is perhaps the most important challenge facing the EU , because it not only affects the security of citizens and their physical integrity , but it also seeks to undermine something very important : it seeks to undermine the values of democratic societies .
This is why it is so important for the European Union to seek joint responses .
I would also like to say that I think the measures are necessary , like everything that we have done , and everything that Mr Frattini says is going to happen , and that the work done by the police is also very significant , but not sufficient .
In my view we also need to strengthen policies that create integration and dialogue between different cultures .
I think that the alliance of civilisations is a valid instrument in the fight against terrorism .
We need to continue with what we discussed in Tampere and the work that we then did in The Hague in order to consolidate what we said : the balance between freedom , security and justice .
This is why the European Parliament hastened to adopt the Prüm Treaty before the summer .
This possibility of quickly and efficiently exchanging accurate information is of vital importance for achieving international cooperation against terror .
It is true that we are saying that we need to reconcile these rights of citizens and human beings with guaranteeing security .
The European Parliament has a decisive role , but , as the Council says , nowadays Parliament does not effectively have a say on what is done in this field .
Either the Council takes a unanimous decision or it takes no decision .
This is why I think that this weakens and curbs the European Union 's power to respond to new challenges .
As Mr Watson said so clearly , the only opportunity the European Parliament has to work with the Council is a courtesy meeting , and as a democratically elected assembly we should have the opportunity to take part in decisions .
We welcome the creation of the European Agency for Fundamental Rights , and we hope that this agency will be able to fairly monitor all the EU 's activities in the field of police and judicial cooperation .
I would also like to point out that our Group supports the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator , whoever it may be , but it should be soon .
What is important is that he or she should not be a paper tiger , but have a clear and strong mandate .
Finally , and I will end here , I think that it is right to say that the European Union 's action in the fight against terrorism and its consequences should include an essential dimension : support and protection for victims and their families .
Mr President , coming from London I in no way minimise the terrorist threat .
Indeed , we Londoners have endured it for decades , including when it was Irish Republican terrorism part-funded from the United States .
The moral high ground is a precarious location .
Europol tells us that there were almost 500 terrorist attacks in the EU last year .
Of course it is a major criminal threat , but so are drug smuggling , people trafficking and corruption .
Where is the Council action to insist that all Member States sign and ratify the European Convention on Human Trafficking ?
Where was the Council protest when the UK Government terminated a major corruption probe in January against ' national champion ' arms manufacturer BAE ?
Just because Liberals question the effectiveness of the liquids ban compared to its inconvenience , or challenge the mass collection of personal data , does not mean that we are soft on terrorism .
No area of policy should escape democratic accountability .
I was proud to be Vice-Chair of the European Parliament 's Enquiry on Extraordinary Rendition and I share the outrage others have expressed on the complete silence of the Council in the face of our findings that many Member States were complicit in massive human rights abuses , of abduction and torture .
The Council would do well to look in its own backyard before it gobbles up the civil liberties of EU citizens .
MEPs have had no information on the implementation of the Framework Decision on Terrorism passed over five years ago .
Has every Member State fully transposed it ?
How many cases have there been ?
How many investigations or convictions have been recorded ?
We know that agencies , even within one state , will not share information because of jealousies , power struggles and turf wars , let alone through cross-border cooperation .
Why not make that a priority instead of frenetically legislating to take away our privacy all the time ?
There is also a lot of inconsistency when it comes to tackling radicalism .
This is an important subject , but it also implies the integration of the vast majority of moderate Muslims , and yet there are parts of the EU where great difficulties are placed in the way of the building of mosques .
Why not look at that ?
Mr Szymański expressed an extreme right-wing view that we cannot pay too high a price for security .
I could not disagree with that more fundamentally .
Is it not what the Communists said to justify their repression ?
Instead of trading too much liberty for security , let us look at what really works : targeted investigations and intelligence-led policing .
That is the way to keep public confidence and cooperation .
- ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 11 September in Brussels many democratic movements with a Catholic and Christian basis organised a major demonstration against Islamic terrorism and in memory of the victims of 11 September , but the socialist Mayor of Brussels banned it on contemptible grounds related to internal politics .
This sends negative signals on terrorism , but more serious still is the wooing of Hamas terrorists by a premier , Romano Prodi , and a foreign affairs minister , Mr D 'Alema .
The political signals sent by Europe should instead be united against Islamic terrorism and we should jointly oppose those who preach in the mosques against us and our security .
I welcome the Commissioner 's statement that European citizens must be more protected and feel more protected , at least as much as US citizens , and that it is therefore necessary to strengthen transatlantic relations .
I ask you though , Mr Frattini , on the imminent danger of terrorist acts waged using bacteriological weapons , for example - God forbid - or by nuclear means : are we prepared ?
Southern Europe proved to be unprepared for the threat of fires , but now it seems to me that we need to do more - much more .
I wish you every success in your work , Mr Frattini .
( EL ) Mr President , let me begin by pointing out that the efforts of recent years to make terrorism a key project and priority for the European Union have turned out to be a non-starter .
The US secret services will be able to monitor everyone 's telephone calls , Internet activity and emails on all servers based in the United States without restriction .
This development is yet another attempt at universal control and the policing of citizens on a worldwide basis , and the EU has unfortunately acquiesced by adopting measures that have proved to be a hindrance to its own development .
A large part of the EU budget is allocated to establishing and strengthening police agencies , military operations , the creation of immigrant detention facilities , etc .
I particularly wish to mention the compilation of lists of terrorists .
These lists are not subject to any democratic or institutional legislative control , or to any procedure of judicial audit or review of appeals .
Even after the decisions of the European Court on 12 December 2006 , when it returned a judgment of deficient controls and failure to comply with the necessary measures to protect human rights , the European Union made only superficial changes .
The fundamental problems remain .
The Member States are not compelled to submit evidence concerning the individuals they propose to include on the list , while , more dangerously still , the Commission itself remains responsible for adding and removing the names of individuals and organisations on that list .
In other words , Mr President , the Commission remains judge , jury and executioner .
( NL ) Mr President , I note to my regret that a great many people in this Hemicycle are once more shying away from calling a spade a spade .
Whether we like it or not , the uncomfortable reality is that international terrorism is purely and simply a war that has been declared on the West and on Europe by Islamic extremists .
We must have the courage to recognise that the enemy is already within our walls .
Jihad networks are operating throughout Europe , and mosques are calling the faithful to a holy war against our open society .
Yesterday we received a further illustration of this in Denmark .
Therefore , the need for comprehensive measures against this Islamic Trojan Horse has never been greater .
After all , we have the right and the duty to defend the values of our open society .
But are we doing so ?
As my fellow Member Mr Borghezio has just said , a typical expression of European cowardice is the decision by Freddy Thielemans , the socialist Mayor of Brussels , to ban a march against the increasing Islamisation of Europe planned for Tuesday 11 September , on grounds that the demonstration could be seen as a snub to the ever-growing , electorally interesting Islamic community .
Europe seeks to propagate the values of an open society , chiefly freedom of expression , all round the world whilst gagging advocates of the same European values in its own official capital .
It says a good deal about this Parliament that no clear position is being taken on this .
Mr President , this debate is about the safety of our people and the preservation of our way of life , our liberal democracy , the rule of law and the defence of freedom .
Terrorism strikes at the very heart of all of these things .
In all its forms , terrorism defines the fight between good and evil , and we must remain ever vigilant .
In Britain we had the IRA to deal with for three decades .
More recently , we have had the London suicide bombings and the attempts to cause carnage in Glasgow .
My colleagues from Spain battle with the evil campaign of terror waged by ETA .
They have our complete support in their courageous response .
Tackling radicalisation is a major challenge , but we live in a world where the terror threat is constantly changing and becoming more sophisticated .
The democracies of the world must remain vigilant , must share intelligence more effectively and must be prepared to take tough action .
Terrorism is an act of war on the fabric of our society .
It is perpetrated by criminals and murderers who detest our liberal democracy and freedom .
Terrorist groups must be banned , and those who perpetrate violence , incite terrorism or give succour to terrorists should be tackled .
In terms of the action that EU Member States can take together , we saw at the weekend the arrest of ETA bomb-makers .
This shows that joint investigation teams add value to the anti-terrorism fight .
Today we vote on the restriction of liquids on aircraft .
The security of the travelling public must be our prime concern - the concern of ourselves , of governments , airport operators and airlines .
But , as with all legislation , improvements can be brought about in the light of experience and I believe there is a case - and a good one - for a review of how that is operating .
At the same time we should rely fundamentally on available intelligence to assist legislators like ourselves in determining the nature and extent of the ongoing threat .
I commend Commissioner Frattini 's proposals , which are positive in that respect .
There is , I appreciate , a delicate balance , but in any event we must always do what we can to protect our people from the evil and murderous intent of terrorism .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that this debate is enabling us , in the meantime , to overcome , to take stock , but also to overcome some dangerous mistakes - a first mistake .
We are debating a strategy against terrorism , not against Islam , and reducing the causes of terrorism in a simplistic way to Islamic fundamentalism would be a rather superficial solution , a rather simplistic reading .
Similarly , some turns of phrase that I have just heard worry me : the mosques bring war into our societies !
These are rather general , rather violent , and rather boorish opinions .
Imagine if in Turkey tomorrow an MP stood up in the Turkish Parliament and said ' the Christian churches bring war into our society ' - what would be the indignant reaction of this Parliament ?
I would also like to make a suggestion to Mr Frattini : we know that enforcement work is absolutely fundamental , just as much as preventive work .
I believe , however , that calculations ought to be made on the basis not of alleged terrorists arrested but on actual terrorists found guilty .
It would be useful to monitor or do some reconnaissance work on how many terrorist suspects have been arrested over recent years in our countries and have subsequently been released .
We have received some replies from the Council , but some of these have been partial answers .
I would like to focus on three points here that we need to explore more deeply : it is not very clear to us what the role of this Parliament ought to be , and how it is to be truly associated with this European Union strategy .
We do not believe - and this has been pointed out by other Members - that a meeting once every six months between the Vice-President and the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and the Council is sufficient .
We believe that a quality and level of consensus is required that cannot be limited to these formal , ritualistic meetings .
It is not clear to us what will happen regarding the functions of the EU counter-terrorism coordinator .
It has been explained to us that this function is primarily linked to providing strategic assessments and disseminating information .
When our committee had the opportunity of talking with Mr de Vries , it was admitted to us that the function was completely devoid of content or tools .
In that case , I believe that nothing can be more damaging than an institutional function that does not have the tools with which to exist or give an account of itself .
Finally , Mr President , it is not clear what position the Portuguese Presidency will adopt on Euro-Atlantic cooperation .
I would like to go back to the very simple and very sincere request contained in our question .
The question was whether this cooperation will be pursued with methods complying with Article 6 of the Treaty as recommended by this Parliament at the completion of the CIA enquiry .
We need a clear answer .
A joint strategy makes sense if it includes full respect for the fundamental rights of citizens , but this has not always been the case .
Mr President , in conclusion , I think I can say that combating terrorism requires a high level of social consensus and we need to be vigilant regarding the principles set out in Article 6 of the Treaty .
Avoiding abuses and avoiding simplification is the only way of ensuring we achieve this consensus .
( NL ) Mr President , democracy , civil rights and the rule of law are things I hold extremely dear ; as are my own life and that of my fellow Europeans .
Talking of a trade-off between the two is dangerous nonsense .
Enemies of democracy must be resisted ; by this I mean terrorists , but also the threat to democracy that is excessive state power and the exclusion of democratic control .
Time and again we hear the Council , and to a lesser degree the Commission , talking about fundamental rights , human rights and democracy , but this rings somewhat hollow when we learn that state control of citizens is growing fast .
Every intimate detail of our private lives is now known .
On the other hand , however , citizens have less and less control of the state .
What is more , the national authorities and the Council refuse to be accountable .
I should like the Council to tell us , for example , the situation with the High-Level Contact Group that is engaged in negotiations with the United States regarding the transfer of our private data .
We are always being told that these are exploratory talks , but the United States seems to think that we are already poised to sign an agreement .
What is the situation , President-in-Office ?
What is the negotiators ' mandate ?
What is the subject of the negotiations ?
This was discussed in Lisbon on 19 and 20 July .
Why are the national parliaments and the European Parliament - European citizens - not being informed about this ?
Another example is the recent US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
Mr Watson and I have asked questions about this .
It is a law enabling the US to monitor almost all of our intra-European communication , telephone calls and emails .
Why does the Council say that this has nothing to do with it ?
Does the Council not have any responsibility to protect the privacy of European citizens ?
The third example is PNR .
We have discussed this subject a hundred thousand times before .
The ink has hardly dried on the agreement and the US has withdrawn its only good component : the application of the Privacy Act to European citizens .
The Commission says that a European PNR system is to be introduced , but has there yet been an evaluation of the results of the American PNR programme ?
I am delighted that the Commissioner says that there is to be an evaluation and that it will cover not only implementation but also the results of the counter-terrorism policy and the impact on fundamental rights , as this is long overdue .
It is interesting that , if you criticise or ask critical questions about the counter-terrorism policy , you often find yourself described as anti-American .
Yet it is actually the Americans who are asking the critical questions and who have carried out comprehensive evaluations in recent months and are putting big question marks on the effectiveness of these measures .
Therefore , instead of playing copycat and adopting bad US policy , Europe must adopt good policy and join with the US to consider what is necessary and what is not .
Ladies and gentlemen , what is politics if it is not patiently working out the causes and consequences of what immediately concerns us ?
Frightening video surveillance systems are being installed everywhere , in public places and even on the streets .
Why ?
To fight terrorism .
We put citizens on file , develop the police services , and sometimes the secret police .
Why ?
To fight terrorism .
We bring back torture .
Why ?
To fight terrorism .
We change laws and increasingly we flout them , and we even flout people 's fundamental rights , the supposed substitute for our Bibles of old .
Why ?
To fight terrorism .
We install anti-missile shields everywhere , even in countries such as the Czech Republic , to the great displeasure of its population which has not experienced any terrorism anyway , and all in the name of the fight against terrorism .
In short , we divide nations , create mistrust between peoples and most of all , we browbeat them , which is what has happened in our European nations , alas , in east and west alike .
Why ?
To fight terrorism .
Ladies and gentlemen , is it not clear that it is not terrorism that absorbs us , but the fight against terrorism ?
An insidious veil is clouding our vision , and we cannot even see it .
Of course I do not deny the vileness of the attacks in our nations , in Spain and the United Kingdom .
However , these examples speak for themselves in that terrorism affected these countries because they supported an act of war : the invasion of a sovereign state .
Moreover , I am not afraid to say that what happened in Iraq was not so much a response to terrorism as another age-old , barbaric form of terrorism that took international tension up a notch .
In truth , terrorism is itself the consequence of a profoundly unbalanced world , dominated by an empire that , like all the world 's empires , denies borders and peoples , aiming to create everywhere a one-dimensional , uniform world , obsessively focused on the value of goods alone .
A world so stifling and violent for the diversity of different peoples that the only response is another kind of violence , one that is obviously equally unacceptable : terror .
Let us have the courage to really think about this .
What if terrorism was primarily a consequence of this new categorical imperative that is imposed by market forces and is part of its logic : the suppression of borders .
Not only is the abolition of borders , the fashion for cross-borderism , doing away with the world 's diversity and infuriating those who want to keep it , but also the disappearance of borders favours the machinations of gangs .
Perhaps this , ladies and gentlemen , is a discussion point that could be added to the debate on the fight against terrorism ?
( PL ) Mr President , the reality of ancient Europe was Hannibal ante portas .
The reality of modern Europe is terrorism ante portas , or at the gates .
For a year now the European Parliament has been formally engaged in an interinstitutional debate .
This is good , particularly as Europe is genuinely continuing to experience terrorist attacks and will certainly experience them in the future .
What we are talking about is imposing real limits on the potential for these attacks to be carried out .
It is therefore right that we should want to know which EU Member States have failed to introduce anti-terrorism measures , measures that were established earlier .
This must be clear to ensure that individual societies do not wake up in shock immediately after attacks have been carried out in their countries .
Likewise , we want to know the real reasons for the resignation of the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator , Mr de Vries .
Was this dismissal prompted by disputes over competence ?
Terrorism is not an abstraction ; it is very real .
I am speaking as the representative of a country whose armed forces are engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan .
For my country , which has no experience of terrorist attacks , terrorism is nevertheless a challenge .
We keep hearing the same thing over and over again and that is the main problem - they are mistaken !
As long as we continue to approach terrorism as a problem falling within the scope of the police and information services , we shall be putting off the central issue .
Terrorism nowadays is closely associated with the symmetrical political principles which promote the clash of civilisations and war , and on that point your silence is deafening .
For example , Commissioner Frattini is announcing measures for controlling explosives at the very time when the war in Iraq has turned into a private business deal worth millions of dollars and when the United States is outsourcing the collection and processing of classified information .
Control explosives ?
I know one way : nationalise the manufacture and trade .
That is the only way to prevent terrorism and counter-terrorism from turning into two sides of the same coin : turning life and death into a business .
( RO ) Madam President , terrorism is a complex phenomenon with a long history , embodied in various forms , from subversive movements aiming at suppressing the sovereignity of states and internal order , triggering civil wars , to attempts , murders and pogroms .
This is the reason why this issue should be approached realistically , with responsibility , and specialists from various fields of expertise should take part in the related debates .
The 9 / 11 terrorist attacks , the tens of thousands victims and the huge damage urge society , the European states and institutions , to take concerted , systematic and permanent action on several axes some of which I would like to remind you of :
1. objectively searching for the causes of this phenomenon and the permanent amelioration thereof .
2. discovering the financing sources for terrorist acts and transnational political and financial networks .
3. determining the relationship between terrorism per se , weapons policy and wars for capturing strategic raw material sources , on the pretence of the fight against terrorism .
Any unilateral approach to the issue of terrorism does not contribute to finding out the truth about it and stamping out this dangerous transnational phenomenon .
- ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , combating terrorism must remain one of the European Union 's main priorities .
Certainly we need effective , constant , coordinated measures to prevent and combat terrorism and so the proposals set out in this Chamber by Mr Frattini are welcome .
First of all , we should not make the mistake of lowering our guard when international terrorism strikes far from Europe .
Unfortunately , the threat from Islamic fundamentalism has not diminished , even when attacks take place far from our borders .
Coordinated action means , above all , cooperation within the EU , as well as strong links with the United States : cutting our links with the United States in the fight against terrorism would be an extremely serious mistake , and would cause very severe damage to the population of the European Union as a whole , but there should also be links with the moderate Arab countries , including those in Al-Qaida 's sights .
Europe must take a leading role in these measures to prevent and combat terrorism , but must ensure that significant action prevails over bureaucratic manoeuvring .
Unfortunately , it is easier to put in place strict controls on deodorant bottles that are not transported in the proper plastic bags than on terrorists who have infiltrated as illegal immigrants .
Therefore , I repeat , strong action by the European Commission and the Council will be welcome .
The fight against terrorism , however , should also be waged through political initiatives to produce a solution , at last , to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis , involving the birth of a Palestinian State and guaranteed security for the Israeli State , without making any concessions to fundamentalist organisations camouflaged as political groups - I am referring to Hamas and Hezbollah .
In the fight against terrorism , though , we should not forget that in Europe , alongside the dangers of the Islamic element , there is a dangerous network of armed groups associated with internal and separatist political movements .
Europe - and I am finishing here - must not lower its guard on this front either .
The events that took place in Spain show us that any time we lower our guard or choose the route of negotiation , terrorists return to the attack .
Madam President , I welcome the responses of Commissioner Frattini and the President-in-Office of the Council .
However , the reality is that we in this House have the luxury of talk , talk , talk .
But actually , in government and in the Commission , you have to take action - action to prevent terrorist attacks : terrorist attacks which are not imagined ; terrorist attacks which are real , which are being planned currently .
The reality of politics is that if you took no action , the same members of this House who attack you for taking the action , would attack you because you had not acted .
Therefore , I welcome the strategy , and the fact that we will review the strategy .
Furthermore , what we have to do , as has been said before , is to tackle the roots of terrorism .
They lie in hopelessness and despair , in poverty , in the preaching of hatred .
Let me say quite clearly and unequivocally , those who espouse a cause , a tradition or a religion for their terrorist acts undermine their ideology , their religion , their cause and their tradition .
Now , above all , we need to act as 27 Member States - not separately - and act in conjunction with our allies , including the United States .
The United States is not a problem .
The attacks on the United States did not occur on September 11 , they occurred before then , and an attack upon one is arguably an attack upon all of us .
Madam President , we all acknowledge the terrorist threat and we must go on reacting to it , without betraying who and what we are .
We are a democratic society , ruled by the rule of law .
It is as such , and only as such , that we must react against criminal acts and support the prevention against possible future attacks .
However , we are entering a very dangerous path where everything appears to be allowed , under the excuse of prevention .
We are subject to the moral blackmail of those who are saying : if you question this measure , you are putting us in danger - even if the measure is abusive or completely useless .
That is unacceptable .
Yet that is what some of us have been accused of by officials of the Commission when , for example , we question the measures in airport security or criticise a regulation that some days ago prevented a group of Catholic pilgrims returning from Lourdes in a Vatican aeroplane to bring holy water with them from Lourdes , which was considered a threat to security .
We have the right to criticise that stupid piece of legislation and not accept the blackmail of being considered friends of terrorists , when fulfilling our responsibilities .
Mr Frattini , this is an area - and I am sorry to say this - in which you are avoiding your responsibilities and where you have left anti-terrorism legislation in the air transport sector in the hands of a group of zealots within the Commission , who are anonymously implementing this legislation in secret .
Your responsibility , as Vice-President of the Commission with responsibility for these matters - for this area - is to prevent this from happening or continuing to happen .
Today you will have the legitimacy of a vote within Parliament that will give you the tools to go and make some demands on your colleague responsible for transport within the Commission .
This is your responsibility , and we expect a lot of you .
Speeches about fundamental rights are blatantly contrary to secret legislation and strongly opposed to arbitrary restrictions on privacy and individual freedom .
Furthermore , much more efficient measures , which have already been approved , have not been implemented .
Do that exercise that you know well how to do : name and shame .
Name and shame the Member States that are not implementing the measures on judicial and political cooperation , and you will have all our support in that .
( PL ) Madam President , so far the concept of terrorism has not been properly defined , and this is more than just an oral problem .
It is a matter of the practical implementation of a strategy to combat one of the greatest threats to the modern world , one that concerns ordinary citizens .
One important area of the European strategy to combat terrorist organisations is transatlantic cooperation .
The United States has shouldered the heaviest burden in tackling this grim phenomenon .
Up to now , certain institutions such as the Council of Europe and , sadly , the European Parliament have set in motion such unhelpful actions as the appointment of strange commissions to try to find alleged CIA prisons in Europe .
The work carried out by these bodies has not contributed to transatlantic cooperation ; in fact it has fuelled anti-American feelings and thus significantly weakened the system of counter-terrorism .
We must express the hope that today 's debate will initiate true commitment on the part of the European Parliament to building a counter-terrorism strategy , and not just the token commitment we have seen hitherto ; this must be a strategy which truly aims to promote safety for all our citizens .
( SL ) It is appropriate ... how terrorism is defeated and in that respect I fully support Mr Frattini and the measures taken by the Commission .
However , it is also appropriate for us to answer the question of why this is happening to us and who it is that is posing the threat .
Last year the Commission proposed that we should not use terms such as ' Islamic jihadism ' and the like and that these people are instead , and I quote , ' terrorists who use religion for their activities ' .
I consider it essential that we recognise that the phenomenon should be called by its correct name .
And to me the correct name is jihadi terrorism because these people are fundamentalists who share a hatred of democratic , pluralistic society .
Their ideology is diametrically opposed to conventional democracies and their aim is to create a caliphate .
Jihadism is often referred to as a religion vying with other religions and as an ideology seeking its place in the world , but this is incorrect .
Jihadism is neither economically inspired nor capable of vying with other religions - it is an ideology aimed at destroying other ideologies .
Therefore , it is necessary to create in the European Parliament and the European institutions the conditions for spreading democracy in the world , a plan of action perhaps , and to strengthen economic and political cooperation with Islamic countries .
Democratic forces capable of confronting other forces exist in the Islamic world .
Those democratic forces can be assisted by various forms of support , say by funding media stations spreading democratic ideas and exposing the acts of terrorists .
It is also necessary to create the conditions for addressing all the various interpretations and opening up discussions , forums and web pages for free thinking Muslims .
The public in Europe must also speak more about terrorism .
And finally , it is also important to recognise that in the fight against terrorism the European Union must be conscious of its values and defend them without fear and without worrying about tactics .
( RO ) This debate is extremely important as it provides us with the opportunity to examine the consistency and coherence of our policies against terrorism .
Today we have enough analytical data to say that the success of these policies relies on the close relationship between several main elements .
On the one hand , there are the measures on security and justice in the European Union , the correct ratio between these measures and the respect for fundamental human rights and on the other hand there is EU foreign policy and the fight against social exclusion , and the social causes of terrorism .
In my opinion , action without prevention is not enough ; domestic measures are not enough without consistent external dialogue .
Their correct mix should be the basis of a European model for combating terrorism , that could ensure the security of EU citizens and their fundamentalrights respectively .
We have to admit that there is a deficiency in the relationship between the European Parliament , its legislative power and the field of the fight against terrorism and this triggers a democratic deficiency .
In order to play an efficient part in the decision-making process at European level , we need total involvement of the Parliament in the co-decision procedure .
I would like to call on the Council to accelerate the procedure of electing a new EU anti-terrorism co-ordinator , with enhanced powers in relation to the strategies agreed .
( FI ) Madam President , the EU 's new counter-terrorism strategy is the right one , but no thanks to the new officials , bodies or organisations .
The first responsibility for combating terrorism lies with the national governments and the independent Member States .
For the fight against terrorism at national level to succeed , however , there needs to be highly effective European and international cooperation based on trust .
As Commissioner Frattini said , trust is a precondition for cooperation .
Trust depends on clear and precise European legislation , clear forms of cooperation , and a respect for human rights .
The fight against terrorism at airports has reached ludicrous proportions .
For example , they confiscate lipstick .
At the same time , the EU and many nation-states have forgotten that natural disasters can also be prevented .
( The President cut the speaker off )
( PL ) Madam President , in the field of medicine , when trying to combat a disease we concentrate not so much on its symptoms as on its deeper , hidden causes ; in much the same way , when combating terrorism we must focus not only on a few kamikaze agents planting bombs , but also on the reasons why they are doing this .
Terrorism is a blind act of violence aimed at satisfying its own demands and inflicting suffering on those all around , and it clearly needs to be stopped .
It is an unacceptable way of satisfying needs that are based on a certain hierarchy .
It is not disinterested aggression .
It is behaviour that we do not like , but it has its own sense .
How can we show Muslims at this time that our hierarchy of needs is better than theirs ?
It is not possible , it is a complex ethical problem , but we must start somewhere .
I suggest that we begin by showing greater respect for the needs of Muslims on their territory in order to lessen their effect in the Western world .
( PL ) Madam President , in the global war on terror , the only way to ensure that fewer people die at the hands of ideological murderers is through good identification and assessment of terrorist threats .
To this end we need a good and practicable European counter-terrorism strategy .
The key to this strategy , in my view , is the creation of a European code of counter-terrorist procedure .
I therefore welcome the Council 's initiative on this matter .
Such a code is needed for reasons beyond simply harmonising the actions taken by Member States .
It should also clearly define which measures are acceptable in the battle to prevent acts of terror .
What we need , then , is the identification and detailed specification of situations in which the threat of terrorism is to be treated as a state of emergency , and mutual agreement on the use of certain concrete measures and certain legal measures , which will unfortunately restrict citizens ' rights and freedoms in some areas .
The reasoned restriction of citizens ' freedoms is necessary , because without such restrictions we can tell the terrorists right now : we care more about your rights and freedoms than we do about the rights of the people you are killing in your attacks .
It is also important to define the role of the counter-terrorism coordinator .
We are faced with a choice : either we continue along the path of strengthening administrative competence and coordinating abilities , as during Mr de Vries 's time - although that path demands that we engage in some serious reflection and draw conclusions from what has happened over the past four years - or we should consider boosting the political profile of whoever holds this post .
However , then the issue of competition with Javier Solana arises .
One way or another , the decision we take on this cannot simply be based on personal views .
( HU ) The riots in French suburbs and the bloody terrorist outrages in London which were committed by young , third-generation Muslims speaking with a Yorkshire accent highlight the crisis in the integration of migrant minorities in western Europe .
An example of this is the Netherlands , which used to be one of the most tolerant of countries in Europe , but is now in effect facing a crisis in interethnic coexistence .
Even as we attempt to deal with the roots of the problem here in Europe in the fight against terror , it is time , as many people have suggested , for us to look again at the issue of the integration of minorities .
Europe has not looked this question squarely in the face .
Neither in the European Council nor in the European Union is there as yet a ' soft law ' instrument on the problem of migrant minorities or - as I myself proposed in the European Council , and it was accepted - on the problem of new minorities , although we know that , in the problem of minorities , both migrant minorities and indigenous minorities , only the acceptance of two or more identities can be a guarantee .
The best example for indigenous minorities is in fact the South Tyrol where they have dual identity , but many examples can be cited .
Europe will not advance if in this area , minority policy , we do not adopt such an instrument .
- It has been pointed out to me that I never say ' Mr or Mrs such and such , you have the floor , thank you ' .
This is not through rudeness but out of respect for your time , because I do not wish to waste it .
That is why I would ask you to remain within the limits of the time set , or else we will never finish .
( RO ) Terrorism is a continuous threat in a Europe where Muslim extremism is often in operation .
The European Union has to take adequate measures and to set up a coherent strategy , common to all Member States .
The Commission 's future legislative proposals with an indirect relationship to this phenomenon should include provisions contributing to the prevention of the spread and intensification of terrorist attacks .
Such an example is the legislative package on legal and illegal migration .
The competent European institutions have to find , without any delay , an efficient way of cooperating based on trust and the exchange of information .
The proper operation of a European Information Centre will depend on the Member States ' mutual trust .
Beside the measures adopted at European level , every state has to contribute to the efficiency of joint action for fighting against all forms of terrorism .
Member States such as Romania , where Islam terrorism is not considered a danger , should be as vigilent as the other European States facing this threat .
These states should receive information and be involved in joint European programmes contributing to the prevention of both the causes and situations triggering terrorist acts .
We do not have to suffice ourselves with prevention or discovering acts of terrorism , we have to identify and fight against the factors favouring these phenomena , such as poverty , social exclusion or extremism .
Inter-religious dialogue can make a significant and decisive contribution to reducing terrorism .
Religious leaders have to consider this issue a priority and to become involved in order to ensure peace , and the stability of the communities they are responsible for .
A good example is the European Ecumenical Assembly taking place these days in Sibiu , Romania .
The European citizens have to be aware of the danger embodied by terrorism .
An information campaign and presentation of all conflict-generating issues should trigger citizen involvement , together with the institutions , in order to eradicate this phenomenon .
( PL ) Madam President , terrorism is a clear evil - it strikes at the life and health of citizens and conveys a threat to nations by cutting at the foundations of their democratic functioning ; so far , however , the terrorists have stayed ahead of the game , striking without warning and sadly often succeeding .
It is only after such attacks that we undertake counter-measures , and thus we are acting ex post .
The examples of Denmark and Germany cited today by the Commissioner are commendable exceptions to this .
Congratulations to their services , but these were national actions , and my question to the Commissioner is this : what about prevention at European level ?
Do we have a system of exchanging good practice in combating terrorism , and how does it work ?
The European Union is adopting new anti-terrorism measures and setting up specialist institutions : we now have Europol and Eurojust , we have the Union 's Situation Centre , SitCen , but do they cooperate effectively with each other , and more particularly , do they exchange information ?
In this context , in the context of institutions , I have a further question for the Commissioner : in your opinion , would Frontex , the institution responsible for guarding the Union 's frontiers , not be better utilised and involved in the anti-terrorism strategy ?
I also have the impression that the delay in introducing SIS II is seriously weakening this strategy .
It appears that Schengen II is important not only to the citizens of the new states , but also , in the context of the war on terror , to the security of the Union as a whole .
( PL ) Madam President , Monday 's arrests in Copenhagen show that terrorism is still a real threat in Europe .
Europol 's report reveals that it remained at a high level throughout last year .
Suffice it to say that last year 498 terrorist acts were recorded .
It is true that this threat is not evenly distributed , with as many as 294 instances taking place in France and 145 in Spain , but at a time of globalisation , the whole territory of the European Union is of interest to terrorists .
Moreover , this is not altered by the fact that a significant majority of these acts are separatist in nature ( something Europe has spent decades getting used to ) , such as Basque or Corsican terrorism , or the left-wing anarchy in Greece .
Does this process of getting used to terrorism mean that we in Europe are well prepared to fight it ?
My conviction is that that the answer is still no .
Implementation of the basic conceptual documents , even something as fundamental as the counter-terrorism strategy , or the legislative instruments in the shape of the framework decision of June 2002 , leaves much to be desired .
Coordination of prevention and reaction to acts of terrorism is also unsatisfactory .
In this regard there is an urgent need to upgrade such cooperation , especially operational cooperation and the exchange of information between Member States ; we need to enhance the capacities of Europol and Eurojust ; we need - and this is something we keep calling for - to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure , especially for transport and energy .
We must also insist that the solidarity clause that was written into the earlier draft of the Constitutional Treaty is included in the new treaty and that a suitable anti-terrorism clause is incorporated into agreements with third countries ; my report was calling for this before the holidays .
( PT ) ( inaudible ) ... the Council 's reluctance to give Europol , Eurojust , the Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and the SitCen any institutional , legal or financial muscle , which could transform ad hoc links into a genuine strategic cooperation against terrorism .
Various Member States have not yet even ratified the main international conventions in this field .
Al-Qaida and ETA do not respect borders or national sovereignty , but our police and secret services are still hampered by inadequate barriers .
Europe needs to be not only more effective , but also more strict , because the anything-goes approach is precisely the way terrorists think and international terrorism did not in fact make its advance in New York , Bali , Madrid , London or even Baghdad .
Its greatest triumph , which every day brings it more recruits , was handed to it by democratic governments , by the ease with which they sacrifice fundamental values , rights and guarantees : the pillars of democracy and civilisation .
Europe needs to clear its name , miserably besmirched by the systematic collaboration of European governments with the Bush Administration in the abduction , unlawful detention and torture of terrorist suspects .
Parliament is still waiting for explanations from those governments .
Europe needs to be more effective in strategic cooperation , internally and with its allies , in order to defeat terrorism but also in order to defeat it through political ideas and through law .
The Portuguese Presidency , under a socialist government , has an obligation to try to make a difference .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , terrorism is a crime against humanity and represents the greatest threat to our society ; and sadly it has already taken on a European dimension .
The question is : has the European Union taken action ?
The answer is a clear ' yes ' , and the successes show that the measures taken have been good ones .
There have been arrests in Denmark and Germany , thank goodness .
I am obliged to Commissioner Frattini for his commitment in this regard ; it shows that the Commission is on the right track .
However , we also need a review of whether our measures are effective , which measures are effective and which new ones are needed .
We should also ask ourselves whether our overall strategy is sufficient .
At all events , we should continue to work on such a strategy following the review .
This strategy is certainly needed before we can decide whether there is to be a new Counter-Terrorism Coordinator .
We must also make it clear in advance to Member States that , if there were to be another such coordinator , he or she would have to have the necessary powers and responsibilities , because otherwise we would certainly not need such a post .
I agree with many others that , at all events , we must strengthen and make use of Europol and Eurojust .
These are successful and have the instruments at their disposal .
We have taken decisions like that of yesterday on implementing rules simplifying the use of analysis files , and an explosives database is to be set up .
However , the problem is the provision of data by Member States .
I would appeal to you , President-in-Office , to exert pressure on Member States to provide data in time .
President-in-Office , you said that regular talks were being held with the United States .
This is a good thing , and makes sense , but I would entreat you to take every opportunity to render the cooperation fruitful , in the interests of both parties .
In other words , I would ask you to negotiate such that , the moment there is a suspicion of terrorism , the United States is obliged ...
( The President cut off the speaker )
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , terrorism represents a serious threat to peace , stability and prosperity in Europe .
As has already been mentioned , terrorism also constitutes an attack on the fundamental values that are the basis of European integration : human rights , the rule of law , freedom and democracy .
That is why I believe that the response from the European Union and the Member States to threats of terrorism must be radical and unequivocal .
This decisive response should not , however , consist merely of repressive security measures .
Instead it should focus on prevention and preventive measures more so than it has done thus far , both within the Member States and externally in relationships with our overseas neighbours .
The objective of our common foreign and security policy should be to strengthen economic and social development , support for civil society and the concept of human rights , striving for peaceful solution to international conflicts , including the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
To a greater extent our common foreign and security policy should also concentrate on support for , and development of , regional cooperation in the framework of both the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Barcelona Process .
Last but not least , Madam President , Commissioner , along with our friends from the US and other countries we should draught a comprehensive UN convention against terrorism .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have seen tragic events in Madrid and London .
We have seen attacks fail , for example because of the discovery or failed detonation of suitcases , as happened in Germany .
Moreover , in recent days we have again seen efficient police work head off attacks in good time , such as today 's news also from Germany .
This makes it clear , of course , that terrorism is a real and great danger , and it is without doubt one of our key tasks as politicians to protect people , to protect human life .
Many of my fellow Members have argued today that one or other of the measures is borderline , and that we must consider whether it represents an excessive threat to civil and fundamental rights .
I consider this a valid question , and agree that this must be examined in earnest , but this examination must not be drawn out for so long that potential measures that are necessary are debated to death .
I believe that we bear responsibility to protect people and human life , and that is the most important thing .
That is our top priority , and therefore I call on us as political leaders to advocate the necessary measures rather than discuss them to death or , for example , forget amid all the criticism to win people over to them - because there is no alternative to them .
I have no time for those contributions to the debate that offset , as it were , any behaviour on the part of the United States or other countries in this regard .
I do not understand this .
It is our duty to protect human life and to implement the necessary measures , and I am obliged to the Commissioner for the further , very specific , proposals he has made today .
I am obliged to those who have said that we must weigh up whether our measures actually do what they are supposed to do .
I am firmly on the side of those who advocate a careful review of whether new institutions are necessary , or whether these tasks cannot also be done very well by existing institutions .
The fight against terrorism plays a vital role , and this is the way it has to be .
Incidentally , in future , if the framework agreement is implemented , we will have ...
( The President cut off the speaker )
Madam President , I strongly support the demand for effective , efficient , balanced and accountable security at the European and international level in addressing terrorism .
If we are to avoid feeding the threat , democratic accountability is essential to ensure balance and proportionality .
But a security response , no matter how effective , is not sufficient .
We must address the international , political and economic injustices which certain demagogues are using to tap into a youthful hunger for justice .
Their appeal is based on a tabloid history , a tabloid politics , which denies the nuances and contradictions which are integral to all of our political and religious traditions .
The battle for hearts and minds requires us to avoid demonising whole communities of religious believers .
It requires open dialogue , not confrontation ; it requires us to address the real and perceived disconnection that some young people are experiencing .
Europe 's idea of ' unity through diversity ' could help , but that requires courageous political leadership , which , unfortunately , is sadly lacking at Council level .
Finally , could I appeal at least to the people , the representatives in this House , to avoid sloppy language , which implies sloppy thinking .
Equating fundamentalism automatically with terrorism is sloppy thinking .
There are millions upon millions of Catholics , Protestants , Jews and Muslims who believe literally in the Old Testament , in the New Testament and the Koran , but they are not terrorists .
There are a tiny number of people who have a literal reading of their religion who are involved in terrorism .
We have to address why that is the case .
Madam President , terrorism is a threat to all states and to all peoples : it poses a serious menace to our security , to the values of our democratic societies and to the rights and the freedoms of citizens .
Obviously , new measures have increased the efficiency in the fight against terrorism , but there is more to do .
We need to show that the creative measures really protect citizens and that they are proportionate to the infringement in the personal sphere .
I doubt whether the regulation on liquids on aeroplanes is proportionate to its purpose .
Some innocent people lose important medicines , not to mention the tonnes of confiscated shampoos , lipsticks etc .
If this brings full security , it will be accepted , but citizens question how this is being handled - improvements are probably possible .
To strike the right balance is to enforce anti-terrorism , the fight against crime , and fundamental rights in a democratic society based on the rule of law .
It should include information to the European Parliament before any European-US deal is signed , and we have full trust in Commissioner Frattini and the Commission in this respect .
To accomplish legitimacy in this field we need increased democratic control through codecision , and European citizens should play a larger part in the decision-making process ; we need more transparency and more democratic legitimacy .
The Council must motivate its measures in public at European level .
We also need to improve transatlantic relations .
Finally , there is a need for tough anti-terror measures .
It will be much easier to achieve that if we better accept our own democratic ...
( The President cut off the speaker )
- ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the summit last April between the European Union and the United States was a lost opportunity .
In the light of the results of the European Parliament 's special committee on secret CIA flights Washington should have been clearly told that progress in transatlantic cooperation on the fight against terrorism can only be based on compliance with Article 6 of the EU Treaty and full respect for human rights .
This was not done : that means that not only will the fight against terrorism not be strengthened , but it will be weakened because , as this Parliament itself has said , as well as being counter-productive , it is unacceptable to combat terrorism using illegal , terrorist methods .
The EU Member States that submitted to US pressure in using these methods have not only infringed the fundamental principles of the EU but have also opened up a path to illegality , exposing Europe to increased risks of terrorist retaliation .
Stepping up the fight against terrorism means , above all , doing so in full compliance with the law .
( PT ) Terrorism challenges our free and open society .
It sometimes even makes us feel tempted to create security legislation which comes very close to eroding the values of our civilisation .
The European Union must therefore , as a matter of urgency , draw up a joint code clearly setting out its principles and methods .
Firstly , it must guarantee the principles of human dignity and the rule of law in all aspects of combating terrorism .
We cannot undermine the moral foundations of democracy which rest on those very values .
As Simone de Beauvoir said , we must not allow our executioners to give us bad habits .
Secondly , uniform legislation must be created for the Member States .
Union on this aspect must actually mean Union .
The fight against terrorism urgently requires the application of rules which are unified and coherent ; that cannot be left to the impulses of each Member State and the public opinion of the moment .
Thirdly , we need to encourage working as a network and to promote consensus via the approval of measures in the European Parliament and the national parliaments .
Fourthly , the European Union needs to work towards setting up a UN international mechanism for monitoring emergency procedures and legislation .
This fight against terrorism is on a grand scale and is not merely confined to Europe or the Euro-Atlantic axis .
Finally , in order to fight terrorism we need to work towards creating a fairer and more balanced international community ; we need to identify causes and fractures , promote a culture of rights that takes in all peoples , and work hard to promote dialogue between civilisations .
Terrorism is a complex phenomenon .
We cannot respond to it with a simplistic interpretation .
( EL ) Madam President , let me first of all put two fundamental questions to the Council : firstly , why is Mr de Vries 's seat still vacant , even after such a long time ?
Does the Council intend to fill it ?
Does the Council consider it useful ?
Yes or no ?
Secondly , why have the adopted anti-terrorism measures not been properly enforced by all Member States ?
More important still is the question of whether , in our effort to counter terrorism , we have taken steps merely as a reaction to terrorist activity .
Are we following an intelligent , integrated strategy in aiming to combat the causes of terrorism ?
We should never lose sight of this .
Fear for our own security often causes us to adopt strategies that create a false sense of security .
I have repeatedly asserted here that the protection of public security is our common , self-evident aim .
However , our method is proof of the maturity of our civilisation .
Respect for our rights is not merely inalienably ours ; it is our only path to welfare and security .
I believe that we need not only to evaluate the effectiveness of all anti-terrorism measures to date , but also to take careful stock of our progress , which must not consist merely of a series of reactions to terrorist activity .
Discussions between the Council , the Commission and Parliament must therefore be stepped up .
The cooperation of the Member States is of vital importance .
Lastly , I believe that we should step up the dialogue with third countries .
I consider this essential , as we have seen how useful cooperation with the United States has been .
( PL ) Madam President , today 's debate concerns the war on terror , the issue of security , the rule of law and personal freedoms , i.e. the highest values in the EU system .
The European Parliament is tabling a series of questions for the Council and the Commission , the solutions to which are crucial to the security of citizens , the respect for law and the status of citizens ' freedoms .
I wish to concentrate here on the issue of the transparency of the European Union 's anti-terrorism strategy .
Democratic control in this area , and especially the role of the European Parliament and national parliaments , guarantees the observance of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Treaty on European Union .
May I remind you that the European Parliament 's resolution on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners recommends the use of methods that are in line with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union .
Madam President , I have just come from a press conference calling for rigorous implementation of economic sanctions against the Iranian regime , a notorious sponsor of terrorism across the Middle East and beyond .
I am sure we all welcome measures that genuinely help in combating terrorism , but I wonder how much of the long list of EU activity that we have heard about this morning falls into this category .
The EU is very good at extending its competences and adding to its bureaucratic apparatus but has little to show for its activity and expenditure .
We have had some discussion of the EU counter-terrorism coordinator .
His title implies some sort of oversight role which is wholly inappropriate .
To my mind , such a person should focus on the workings of the EU and on limited areas where there is clear added value from joint action .
I have great respect for Commissioner Frattini but the EU really cannot claim credit for the actions of our national police and security services .
It would be useful to carry out an independent audit of the EU 's so-called counter-terrorist measures .
Counter-terrorism must remain a national responsibility and a matter of international cooperation .
The EU should be concentrating on ways in which it can support that nationally-delivered counter-terrorism effort .
One of the serious difficulties in our efforts to protect our citizens comes in the failure to control our borders ; terrorists come and go and continued uncontrolled immigration is a major obstacle to the proper integration of our settled immigrants .
This must be a key element in any counter-terrorist strategy .
This problem also brings into question the whole principle of free movement of people and that is another area that should be examined again by an independent body .
I mentioned the responsibility of our national authorities for these matters .
I am sorry to say that the British authorities have failed disastrously to control our borders .
Not only do we have little idea who enters and leaves our country but there are serious question marks over the Border and Immigration Agency , which is charged with implementing controls .
I am alarmed to read that a woman who for many months knew the suspected terrorists currently on trial for terrorist offences in Glasgow and who apparently did not report his activities is now employed as an immigration ...
( The President cut off the speaker )
( ET ) Ladies and gentlemen , in discussing combating terrorism I would like to focus on Article 6 of the Maastricht Treaty , which concerns fundamental rights and freedoms .
My work as leader of the delegation to Moldova and as a social democrat has been dedicated to the security of Europe , safeguarding our values and disseminating them in the neighbourhood policy countries .
We want stability and peace to reign in the vicinity of the European Union .
To combat terrorism we also need support from countries such as Pakistan , Russia and even Iran .
Our successful defence of our values depends to a great extent on how we are able to involve partners .
Any curtailment of fundamental freedoms and rights in the European Union is reflected back fifteen-fold by the 15 neighbourhood policy countries , to say nothing of Russia and China .
Third countries observe what we do , not what we say .
The Commission and the Council must understand that the backing of our own citizens in the fight against terrorism will evaporate if we are unable to honour some of the fundamental rights enshrined in our founding treaties .
Madam President , I am not going to take part in this stupid debate on liquids .
The only people entitled to do so are security and technical experts .
If they come to clear conclusions , then it is only our duty to react immediately .
Nothing scares terrorists more than our ability to react .
The threat of terrorism is built on our rigidity - the rigidity of settled , conservative systems - and our lack of ability to adapt to new dimensions in communication , flows of information , money transfers and flows of persons .
The only way forward is to create floating structures , ad hoc teams , the horizontal , interoperable sharing of information and cross-agency and cross-state cooperation , and to empower Europol and Eurojust .
The resignation of Mr de Vries was clearly a very bad sign .
It was confirmation of the EU 's inability to overcome a stupid , old-fashioned , nation-based security approach .
It was sadly symptomatic of a lack of ability to share information and execute decisions .
The Reform Treaty , on the other hand , sends a great and positive signal .
Minimum rules on police cooperation , the approximation of criminal and civil codes , mutual recognition of criminal and civil judgments , as well as EU protection of evidence , victims of crimes and criminals themselves , are measures which state that with a lot of energy , money and political pain we can cope with terrorism and that we can be of some help to the European citizens of London , Glasgow and other threatened locations .
Commissioner , Member States have until December 2007 to implement the third Money Laundering Directive .
I call on the Commission to be clear and decisive in its push for implementation of the necessary security measures to control money laundering and the financing of terrorism .
This will be of help to us and we have to help you .
Then we can say clearly that we are ready to fight and to win .
( PT ) 12 December 2006 is a historic date , when the European Court ruled fully in favour of the argument that , years ago , I defended in this very Chamber against the Council and the Commission , on the right to be informed about an accusation of terrorism .
I appeal to the institutions to do what they are in fact called upon to do .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think this has been an extremely useful , interesting and highly opportune debate , all the more so in the light of recent events in Denmark and Germany , as mentioned previously .
I shall relay many of your suggestions , concerns and advice to the Council - as is my duty - and I should like to assure you that the Portuguese Presidency is , naturally , open to cooperation and dialogue with Parliament , having regard to the legal provisions by which we are governed .
This is naturally a difficult and complex debate .
Some people think that we should go further ; others think we have gone too far and should perhaps take a step back .
Some people criticise whilst others applaud ; some condemn , others encourage .
However , we all , of course , agree that we must wage a firm and determined fight against this new scourge known as terrorism and that we must in no way call any truces in this fight .
This is for us too a learning process , a continuous process of improvement .
This is a new threat which was not known to us before and which we were not used to fighting and tackling .
We therefore naturally need to be constantly improving , learning and active to ensure that there is no repetition of attacks such as those we have witnessed .
We have worked hard and , quite rightly , cooperated and collaborated widely with third countries .
This is an international fight .
No Member State standing alone could effectively face either the struggle or the threat which lie ahead of us and neither could any organisation or any group of countries standing alone .
We need very strong international cooperation .
In preparing for this debate , I made a note of the set of measures and actions we have taken in the field of prevention , protection , pursuit and response to terrorist attacks .
I concluded that , although there is still much to be done , a great deal has already been done and we shall have to try to improve in those areas where we have not done as well as we should have .
Here it is essential to mention the evaluation mechanisms which we have set up specifically to enable us , after the measures have been in operation for some time , to draw conclusions to help us to improve the measures taken .
I should like to say that for the Portuguese Presidency as for the Council , the fight against terrorism can only be waged and will only be waged , I can assure you , within the framework of respect for our fundamental values and principles , the very points at risk in our fight against terrorism : that is , the defence of those principles and those values .
It would not do for us to neglect or disregard them in our fight against terrorism .
The Portuguese Presidency will be particularly vigilant on that point and will not compromise .
Finally , I should like to say - this point has received great attention here and I mentioned it myself in my first speech - that the Presidency is working in close coordination with the Secretary-General of the Council in examining the issue of the counter-terrorism coordinator , that is , how to extend his powers and capabilities to enable him effectively to play the role for which the position was originally created .
I realise that there might be some delay here .
The Portuguese Presidency undertakes to speed up the debate within the Council 's bodies and , at the appropriate time , announce the appointment of a new counter-terrorism coordinator .
As I said , I will of course take away advice , suggestions and concerns from this debate .
We are not and never shall be indifferent to your points of view ; we do not claim , and never have claimed , to be perfect or to say that all we have done was well done , irreproachable or not open to criticism .
On the contrary , our efforts will always be directed towards improvement in order to ensure that our societies always remain free , open and democratic societies , standing up to those societies who do not want that to be the case .
Thank you very much .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank all those who have spoken in this debate , which is so important .
Some have said that terrorism pursues a political strategy .
I agree with this , Mr Mayor Oreja .
Terrorism must be tackled with a global political strategy .
You have said a lot about prevention , and the fight against violent radicalisation .
In my introduction I gave some specific indications about some proposals .
I can tell you that there is an important initiative on violent radicalisation .
In a little over a month , on 16 and 17 October , a European conference will be held for the first time on the role of education and schools in eradicating violent radicalisation among the youngest members of society .
We have called upon the world of education in Europe and , obviously , I invite observers from the European Parliament who would like to participate .
This will be an opportunity to say clearly that we want to replace the culture of evil and violence with a culture of tolerance and cooperation .
We are mapping all the initiatives launched in the Member States to combat radicalisation and prevent the recruitment of terrorists .
The results and the good practices revealed by this mapping will naturally be made available to Parliament .
We have talked a lot about dissemination and exchange of data and information .
Often , ladies and gentlemen , we have a lot of data , in fact an overdose of data , but no adequate analysis of the data .
This is why we need to give Europol a stronger role .
I thank all those who supported the strengthening of Europol , including Mr Pirker .
Last December I put a proposal before Council on this subject and I hope that the Portuguese Presidency will support the adoption , before the end of this year , of an increased analytical role for Europol .
In July an initiative on bioterrorism was presented .
We indicated very clearly what the vulnerable sectors are and where greater European cooperation is required - I am addressing Mr Borghezio who raised the issue .
Some have spoken of failures by the Member States to act .
I am in favour of ' naming and shaming exercises ' .
Last June I published a document highlighting very clearly which Member States are in default even in implementing the legislation in force against terrorism .
This shows , and here I am addressing Mr Guardans Cambó in particular , that I am ready to point out responsibilities , but these exercises will only be useful if all the Member States and the Council regard a statement of failure to act as a suggestion and encouragement to move forward .
Many have spoken about transatlantic relations .
I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that greater collaboration with the United States is required , and , at the same time that we need more involvement by Europe .
Among others , I would like to thank Mr Cashman for having expressed this principle .
It does not make sense for us to be slow in preparing and developing a European model and at the same time to reproach the United States because they , in fact , do have a model .
I think that more European input is needed , and more collaboration with the United States , but there is no need to say that Europe 's problem is the United States .
The problem is the terrorists and their activities in the heart of Europe .
This is the point to bear in mind .
( Applause )
One last thought : I am certain that the new European Treaty will give us better instruments , that it will give us an instrument with which to work together with Parliament in order finally to create co-responsibility between the three institutions .
This will also give us in the Commission and the Council more strength .
I think that at that moment all citizens will be able to understand and see , transparently , who has made a mistake , who has acted correctly and who has not acted when they should have done .
Thus , the hope is that this treaty will become a reality , that it will be agreed , finally , and that this Parliament will become , with us , a fully-fledged institutional actor in the fight against terrorism .
( Applause )
Thank you , Mr Frattini .
I apologise for the noise , but it was not a lack of courtesy towards you .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place on 11 October .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
Even though some speakers have repeated to exhaustion the safeguarding of human rights in this ' fight against terrorism ' and in the offensive of security measures backing up that fight , a growing number of situations and facts point to a failure to respect citizens ' fundamental freedoms , rights and guarantees .
in writing . - The EU is all about free movement of people , goods , services and capital .
Obstacles for these are to be taken seriously .
The fight against terrorism as part of international crime must not be neglected .
Terrorism is , however , a delicate topic .
We must not ever forget that all policies on counter-terrorism have to be based on respect for fundamental rights and human dignity .
Measures also need to be effective and proportionate to the gain of security .
I doubt , for example , that the new restrictions on liquids on aeroplanes meet these criteria .
All in all , every effort towards better coordination between Member States , and between them and the EU institutions , should be welcomed .
After Mr de Vries stepped down , a new EU anti-terrorism coordinator should be appointed as soon as possible .
( NL ) Mr President , I would only note that , during the debate , the President-in-Office of the Council - who has already left - and the Commission were asked some very precise questions to which we have not received replies .
I should like a written reply from the Council and the Commission to my questions regarding the High-Level Contact Group on Data Protection and the US Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act .
We will proceed in line with the Rules of Procedure and also on the basis of the request made .
Membership of Parliament : see Minutes

Mr President , on a point of order , can I ask for an urgent action by the President of Parliament to call for the protection of a delegation from Colombia which visited our Parliament on 27 and 28 June , and whose members this week received a public death threat because they had spoken out here in favour of the proposal for a humanitarian exchange of prisoners in the Colombian conflict ?
The accusation that the delegation 's members , including Yolanda Pulecio de Betancourt , mother of the French former Colombian presidential candidate , Monsignor Luis Augusto Castro , the head of the Catholic Church in Colombia , and Dr Jose Noe Rios , the general secretary of the Colombian Liberal Party , are all supporters of the country 's guerrilla movement , is both preposterous and puts the group in grave danger .
On humanitarian grounds alone , I ask the President to do everything possible to make representations for their safety .

Mr President , concerning declarations of interest , could you explain to me whether , in the vote on the next three reports on milk , the dairy farmers among us should declare an interest and refrain from voting ?
( Applause )
Obviously , Mr Titley , we proceed on the basis of declarations signed by individual MEPs with reference to conflicts of interest at the time of taking on the mandate and with reference to individual parliamentary procedures .
Explanations of vote
in writing . - ( PT ) We regard the sustainability of fishery resources as essential for the continuation of fishing activity and the viability of the fisheries sector , but we do not accept a fleet management policy - as adopted in the EU - or a reduction in the fleet , the main consequences of which will be a significant reduction in the means of production and a drastic loss of jobs .
To achieve the objective of a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities , account must be taken of the social and economic situation in the fisheries sector by applying mechanisms for subsidising or compensating fishermen affected by the economic consequences of an environmentally friendly fishing activity and by measures to reduce fishing , especially in less-favoured regions that are dependent upon the fisheries sector .
Similarly , the fishing effort should be matched to existing resources and to the protection of the marine environment - which would at one and the same time promote small-scale coastal fishing and non-industrial fishing and safeguard fishing communities ; it would be particularly helpful in that context to increase Member States ' exclusive fishing zones from the current 12 nautical miles to 24 nautical miles and for outermost regions from 100 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles .
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague Mr Casaca because it clearly underlines the perverse effects of the current system , which sometimes causes decisions to be taken that are disconnected from local realities .
Take , for example , the case of thonaille fishing in the Mediterranean .
Those who do it have made efforts to develop their fishing methods , but legislation adopted recently is putting disproportionate restrictions on them that are in danger of causing their disappearance .
They are in fact facing unfair competition from their colleagues in the Eastern Atlantic , both Spanish and French .
In accordance with the report 's proposals , an approach using geographical fishing areas and taking account of the specific features of the techniques employed would have made it possible to ensure a fairer distribution of fishing effort capable of guaranteeing a sustainable balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities .
in writing . - I support the Elles report on the draft amending budget No 5 / 2007 .
In doing so , I would like to point out a particular problem for my own country that might mitigate against support for additional spending .
The problem Britain has is that Margaret Thatcher with the 1984 Fontainebleau Agreement left future British Governments with a poison pill .
Fontainebleau gives Britain back a rebate of two-thirds the difference between our annual contributions and annual receipts from the EU .
Thus any new expenditure programmes cost Britain twice ; first we pay our 50 % and then lose two thirds of the EU contribution , diminishing uniquely in our case the EU contribution from 50 % to less than 17 % .
Allowing for the fact Britain 's contributions are just below 15 % of the total budget , any new project for which Britain receives less than a third of the benefits leaves Britain out of pocket .
in writing . - ( PT ) The report states that approximately 110 billion tonnes / km of dangerous goods - dangerous for the population and the environment - are transported annually within the EU , accounting for almost 8 % of total transportation of goods .
Of those , 58 % are transported by rail , 25 % by air and 17 % by inland waterways .
The international transportation of dangerous goods is regulated by international agreements .
In that context , we believe that the useful and necessary cooperation at EU level must safeguard the full sovereignty of the Member States as regards the transportation of ( dangerous ) goods within their territory , for example by means of the right to regulate , to issue individual authorisations and forbid the transportation of dangerous goods , notably for reasons of national security or environmental protection .
This is a matter of principle that is all the more important in the context of the unbridled liberalisation of transportation promoted by the EU .
The Commission proposal on the simplification and unification of European legislation on the transport of dangerous goods should be endorsed in its entirety , including in the interests of better regulation .
As recently as 31 August 2007 I visited the traffic management headquarters for seven road tunnels , among them the longest tunnel in Germany , and became aware of the need for harmonisation , particularly of the provisions on the transport of dangerous goods in tunnels .
The transport not only of goods per se , but also of dangerous goods , is growing rapidly - and this is happening worldwide so that even the increase can no longer be absorbed by a single mode of transport .
It makes sense , therefore , to adopt the relevant rules for transport not only by road and rail , but also by inland waterway .
This improves the chances of applying the co-modal approach to the problem of our transport needs .
It is particularly worthy of mention in terms of the understanding of our fellow citizens that the present legal act takes account not only of the specific recommendations of the United Nations but also of Member States ' subsidiarity requirements .
The fact that the directive summarises four ' old ' directives and saves 2 000 pages of legislative text makes it an example of bureaucracy reduction in action .
Member States will retain the right to regulate or even prohibit the transport of certain dangerous goods within their territory , for example , for reasons of national security or of environmental protection .
In the final analysis , the public can expect this directive to make a contribution to improving both transport safety and environmental safety .
For once the Commission proposal aimed at harmonising the rules for the transport of dangerous goods is a step in the right direction .
Indeed the proposed text aims to simplify and unify existing Community legislation .
Currently no less than four directives and many Commission decisions govern the transport of dangerous goods by land ( rail , road ) and inland waterways .
This disparate collection means that the rules are too complex , difficult to transpose into national legislation and often obsolete .
This is a particularly important subject because the volume of inland transport in the EU is constantly increasing , as is the volume of dangerous goods .
Nearly 110 billion tonnes / km / year of these goods are transported annually in the EU , amounting to 8 % of all goods transported .
Because of its strategic position as the crossroads of Europe , France 's road , rail and waterway networks are often congested and therefore particularly subject to transport accidents .
It is high time all the peripheral , excessive EU legislation on this matter was eliminated to enable the various operators , but also the national authorities , to guarantee and fully strengthen the safety of this type of transport .
Given the continuous rise in freight transport , the catastrophic lorry fire in the Gotthard Tunnel and similar occurrences will certainly not be the last horror stories about lorry accidents .
This is particularly the case since lorries play a disproportionately frequent role in accidents on motorways , and since rest periods are often not observed owing to ever decreasing margins and ever increasing competitive pressure .
Poorly upgraded roads and the formation of tailbacks also increase the potential danger .
If a vehicle transporting dangerous goods is involved in such an accident , the consequences are , of course , all the more serious .
In addition , time and again , radioactive , corrosive or explosive freight is transported illegally , putting the emergency services in mortal danger when accidents occur .
It is only right and proper that the safety requirements be updated , which is why I , too , voted in favour of the report , although checks should also be reinforced accordingly .
in writing . - ( PT ) One of the EU 's basic obligations and responsibilities is to create safe living conditions for European citizens .
The volume of inland goods transport within the EU is constantly expanding and , in line with that increase , the volume of dangerous goods transported has also been rising .
We therefore need to ensure that the legislation applicable to the transportation of dangerous goods is simplified and clarified .
The intention to include under a single directive the transportation of dangerous goods by rail , road and inland waterways might encourage co-modality and , by the application of established rules , improve safety and speed based on the adoption of new criteria on fast delivery of goods and provision of the relevant services .
A prerequisite for that is , therefore , ever greater safety in transportation throughout the territory of the EU , including the transportation of dangerous goods ; I believe that will be possible with the implementation of the measures contained in this directive .
I am voting in favour of Bogusław Liberadzki 's report on the inland transport of dangerous goods .
Professor Liberadzki is a leading specialist in the field of transport .
The report he presents is professionally written and gives an in-depth analysis of the problem raised .
One of the European Union 's priorities is undoubtedly to ensure that Europeans enjoy safe living conditions .
This also includes the safety of transport throughout the Union , and particularly the transport of dangerous goods .
The increased circulation of goods and services has brought about an increase in road , rail and river transport .
That is why I am supporting the initiative to bring these forms of transport together under a single directive .
I feel that at European level we should strive to establish legislation with the greatest added value for EU citizens .
Encapsulating the regulations in a single EU document will enhance their transparency and accessibility and also the efficacy of their application .
( DE ) Mr President , I voted in favour of the Jeggle reports , because I hope they will facilitate the survival of our farmers .
After all , there was a time when farmers could make a very good living from their produce .
Nowadays , food prices are rising continuously but , whilst large enterprises benefit from this and harvest handsome profit margins , simple farmers are pushed increasingly into the role of supplicants .
Often , smallholders need a supplementary source of income to survive , and the love of nature is the overriding and only reason many take on this dual burden .
Increasing numbers are throwing in the towel , however , which has already led to a dependence on imports in the field of fruit , vegetables and feeding-stuff production .
Since EU accession , over 50 % of Austrian farmers have given up their businesses ; that is , ceased milk production .
Thus we are rapidly approaching the point at which our self-sufficiency in fresh milk and fresh-milk products is under threat .
( CS ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during today 's vote on the three milk reports I expressed my support for the Commission proposals , as I believe they represent steps in the right direction .
The over-regulation of the market in milk and milk products for drinking milk in the EU is both unnecessary and senseless and both consumers and producers suffer as a result .
It is therefore only right that the existing rules be liberalised .
It is commendable that besides the three existing categories of drinking milk , additional categories of drinking milk with other fat content be allowed .
As a result , both consumers and producers will be able to exercise a greater choice .
Such a development can only be welcomed .
In fact , the Commission should vigorously pursue the liberalisation of the drinking milk market , because the existing system of milk quotas is both antiquated and functionless .
There is no reason to continue imposing fines on producers for producing large quantities of milk .
Now , at a time when the demand for milk and drinking milk products is increasing throughout the world , milk quotas are clearly proving to be an obstacle to the development of the milk industry throughout the EU .
in writing . - The current strength in the milk sector is creating great optimism amongst dairy farmers in Europe .
Growing appetites for dairy in Asia , shrinking European production and increased use of land production in the US for biofuels is driving the price of dairy to a record high .
As an MEP representing rural Ireland , I am happy that dairy farmers are getting a deserved break , although production costs continue to rise making it harder for smaller dairy farmers in particular to survive .
A change in market management mechanisms brings instability .
With the milk quotas scheduled for removal by 2015 , provisions need to be made to absorb volatility in the market .
The reaction of the producers is unknown .
An increase in output of milk will lead to a drop in prices .
Safeguard mechanisms allowable under the WTO will be crucial for stability .
At present , export refunds are zero rated due to the strength in global dairy markets .
We should ensure that they are retained as mechanisms that could potentially be introduced at a later date .
Change is inevitable in the dairy sector , but there needs to be a well managed transition to provide the farmers of Europe with a stable and bright future .
in writing . - ( PT ) We agree with the line taken in the report that it is important to give an essentially qualitative boost to the school milk programme .
We regret , however , that in its present form with the management philosophy adopted and with the resources currently allocated , this programme has in many cases become an encouragement to stop drinking milk in view of the poor quality and unsatisfactory nature of the products offered in relation to the tastes of pupils in lower secondary school .
We therefore agree that the range of products for inclusion in this programme should be expanded both as regards diversity and in terms of nutritional considerations and dietary rationalisation .
However , we must remember that we need to solve , as a matter of urgency , simple issues such as the lack of refrigeration networks , because that prevents schools and many Portuguese students from having access to anything other than UHT milk .
The nutritional value of milk is well known , and we know that we need to encourage people to drink it .
However , in order to make that possible , aid is required to help to produce quality milk and it is the innumerable small herds that hold the key ; it is in the main family farms which , by means of non-intensive dairy farming , keep the rural communities alive and the countryside populated .
in writing . - ( SV ) The reports on milk products from the Agriculture Committee are a mixed bag .
The June List supports the Commission on the point that it must be permitted to produce and sell drinking milk that is not classified in any of the three categories that apply at present .
Such liberalisation is good and makes things easier for Sweden , which since 1995 has had problems adapting Swedish traditions to the EU 's rigid rules on milk products .
The other two milk reports build on the EU 's Common Agricultural Policy and are rejected by the June List .
Milk production should be a matter for the free market , subject to normal food controls on public health grounds .
The Agriculture Committee 's amendments in the report on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products are simply absurd .
They propose that budgetary savings that are made are redistributed in the milk sector and that a milk fund restructuring programme is set up , that support is given to those within the milk sector who are affected by increasing market liberalisation , that marketing support measures and milk promotional activities are stepped up , that support is given for milk production in mountain regions and that the scheme to distribute milk to schools is reinforced .
We are strongly opposed to these proposals .
The June List would observe that it is just as well that the European Parliament does not have codecision powers in the EU 's agricultural policy , because the Union would then fall into a trap of protectionism and heavy subsidies for all the different groups in the agriculture sector .
The Danish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen , Mrs Thomsen , Mrs Schaldemose , Mr Jørgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against not only the Commission 's proposals but also the amendments proposed by Parliament .
In the delegation 's opinion , reform of the scheme to distribute milk to schools is necessary , but the proposal does not go far enough .
The delegation believes that support for high-fat milk should be abolished completely , whilst healthy milk should receive the greatest support .
However , the delegation wishes to emphasise its support for reform of the EU 's agricultural support in the direction of greater market orientation , and EU agricultural policy should be linked to environmental policy and public health initiatives , among other things .
in writing . - In order to ensure the integrity of this Parliament , all Members who have a financial interest in the dairy sector should declare an interest in these votes .
( DE ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this resolution , as I believe there comes a time when we need to review this measure and assess whether it is really appropriate and effective .
If it is not effective , we will abolish it ; if it is only partially effective and appropriate , it will have to be modified accordingly .
At all events , however , we should be working towards standardising implementation - that is , ensuring uniformity of checks - so as to put an end once and for all the vexation we are currently experiencing at airports .
( MT ) I would like to explain that there should not be any compromises as far as security is concerned .
We have to appreciate that when it comes to the restrictions on taking liquids on an aeroplane , it is true that it is an inconvenience , it is true that it is annoying to have to throw away what you are carrying , but on the other hand , security is paramount ; security is the best way .
If the British secret services are telling us that there is still a threat , then there is still a threat .
We cannot make any compromises , and that is why we have to be very careful when adopting resolutions and approving motions relating to this matter so that we do not appear in any way weak or feeble in our attitude .
( SK ) During my regular business trips I witness annoying problems faced by passengers carrying liquids in their hand luggage at European airports .
Passengers must part with their cosmetics .
Fortunately they can manage to drink a half-litre bottle of mineral water but aftershave or shampoo exceeding the permitted limit will meet its end in a ready container .
Passengers see these strict airport controls as a violation of their rights .
They do not know why they have to do this and are angry with the Union , with its bureaucratic rules .
The purpose of their flight is different and therefore they do not understand why they have to part with basic hygiene products .
Nor do the employees have the time or the inclination needed to justify the strict controls in place as an anti-terrorist mechanism .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution , which proposes ending the controversial measures affecting air passengers and emphasises the need for research studies to find efficient tools for the detection of explosives in liquids .
I believe that the European Commission will thoroughly review the ban on taking liquids on board aircraft and - if no further facts are uncovered - it will abolish this controversial measure .
in writing . - Although UKIP makes the point on principle to support any repeal of EU Legislation , this is a national security issue and as such the party could not support a measure that could place air passengers and crew at risk .
As HMG has stated , terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat .
in writing . - Although UKIP makes the point on principle to support any repeal of EU legislation , this is a national security issue and as such the party could not support a measure that could place air passengers and crew at risk .
As HMG has expressed , terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat .
HMG 's view :
HMG welcomes the TRAN Committee resolution 's acknowledgement that Europe needs a high level of security in aviation .
Terrorism remains a serious and continuing threat .
It is currently impractical to test more than a small proportion of the liquids that passengers wish to carry .
So the interim controls , pending work on a more convenient technology-based solution , represent the only present way of properly ensuring passenger safety .
in writing . - I voted for this resolution particularly because of the demand contained within it for a review of the effectiveness and fairness of Regulation ( EC ) No 1546 / 2006 ( introduction of liquids onto aircraft ) .
What I find most absurd is that I can fly into Europe with duty-free liquids - alcohol , perfume or food bought outside of the EU - but should I transit to another plane within the EU , it will be confiscated by the authorities .
Does it not occur to the Commission that terrorists probably are more aware of the Regulation than your average passenger and will therefore act accordingly ?
It equally implies that security at all extra-EU airports are inferior to the worst EU airport .
As a regular air traveller , I find that difficult , if not impossible , to believe .
Moreover , it was emphasised that if the Commission intends to present a regulation of this kind in the future , it must first produce a report proving that such a measure will be effective .
I would point out that , although the current regulation is being applied , the Commission has not even published or made available to the public a specific statement of the prohibitions and restrictions to which they might be subjected , a list of exceptions to those rules or the reasons for the measure .
Nor did the Commission ensure that air passengers were fully and correctly informed of their rights , especially as regards cases of abuse of power in the application of the security rules .
in writing . - I support moves to review the current restrictions on the quantity of liquids passengers are allowed to carry on board aircraft in the EU .
I voted in favour of the resolution which asks the European Commission to review the restrictions and ensure they are proportionate to any risk .
We need restrictions that are realistic and in proportion to any potential threat .
We all take the need to guard against terrorist threats very seriously , but our response has to be proportionate and justified .
There is cross-party concern that the current restrictions imposed by the European Commission are disproportionately costly and disruptive .
I would like to see the situation reviewed , and if these restrictions are to continue , then the Commission needs to clearly justify precisely why they are needed .
in writing . - British Conservatives fully support a review of the Regulation governing what liquids passengers can and cannot take on board aeroplanes .
The way in which this Regulation has been applied across the EU has varied , giving rise to inconsistencies and manifest unfairness , and any review must address this aspect as a matter of urgency .
However , we do not consider it would be right to call for a repeal of the regulations at this stage , since as a matter of principle the outcome of an expert review should not be pre-judged and protection of the public is paramount .
in writing . - UKIP supports the repeal of all EU legislation .
However , this is a particular measure which would put passengers and crew at risk and which we cannot therefore support .
in writing . - I voted against this Resolution which seeks to repeal the existing regulation , introduced last year , that restricts liquids on board aircraft .
I am worried that British Liberal and Green members of the European Parliament have now opened up the possibility of repealing this law , even though the strong advice from both the Security Services and the Department of Transport is to keep this legislation in place .
While I agree with reviewing the legislation on an ongoing basis , it is both premature and dangerous to repeal the legislation at present .
in writing . - ( PT ) I think that the threat to the security of air transport is a real one and that the risks involved are enormous .
I therefore believe that the inconvenience to passengers is proportional to what we are protecting and that the issue here is in no way a violation of rights , freedoms or guarantees , but simply a technical measure that has proved effective .
I therefore consider that the European Parliament is being too hasty and over-stepping its brief in asking that the Regulation on the introduction of liquids onto aircraft should not be implemented unless new proof is produced in support of such implementation .
The precautionary principle would dictate that it is better to suffer some slight inconvenience than a disaster .
The security principle dictates that we should not make things easier unless we are sure of the risks involved .
I therefore voted against the motion for a resolution laying down measures for the implementation of common basic standards on aviation security ( introduction of liquids onto aircraft ) .
At a time when a large number of holidaymakers are heading back to work , it is worth thinking about some of the safety rules on board aircraft and at airports .
As a reminder , more than 16 million passengers transit through Brussels National airport each year , and since last November they have been subject to a ban on carrying liquids in their hand luggage .
There is no question as far as I am concerned of compromising security .
However , a large number of passengers have complained about the way this ban is enforced at different European airports : at some , they can carry products purchased at the airport in their hand luggage , and at others they cannot .
What is more , it is difficult to impose this kind of measure on passengers if its added value in terms of security has not been proven beyond doubt , and this does not seem to be the case .
So it seems reasonable to me to ask the Commission to demonstrate the validity of this measure , and if it is proven , to provide for uniform application , in total transparency .
That way , passengers will finally know which way to turn .
in writing . - I voted against this report because , whilst it makes real sense to review the impact of this measure , it is important not to repeal it .
The passengers that travel through European airports like Gatwick in my region are often confused and upset with the application of this rule .
In particular the way in which passengers are expected to turn over their ' duty-free ' liquids purchased at an airport to the authorities checking hand luggage .
The problem seems to be with passengers in transit who buy in the ' transit ' airport and then attempt to check through security for their further flight .
I opposed a full repeal because there are still legitimate security concerns which must be our first priority .
There are also alternatives to a simple repeal which might produce better convenience for passengers and maintain security .
in writing . - The current , mindless airport and aviation security measures are an unfortunate and constant reminder of terrorism .
They do not instil public confidence .
There have to be security checks - both on the public side and airside . But these should make sense and be flexible .
Above all , they should be targeted more effectively .
This means ' profiling ' , a key measure that is avoided for fear of a ' discrimination ' accusation .
It is curious that the European Commission thinks it has to give the green light to new security measures for Europe 's airports .
Governments of EU countries should co-ordinate their response - but this must not be an excuse to extend the competence of the Commission into new areas .
Certainly the British Government must resist any further attempt to remove our national veto on justice and policing matters .
The International Civil Aviation Organisation , with its global reach , is the appropriate body to ensure that airports around the world meet security needs .
We abstained on the resolution .
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague Mrs Ayala Sender in response to the Commission communication on freight transport logistics in Europe and sustainable mobility .
We are going to be looking forward to the Commission 's report on an Action Plan for freight transport logistics in Autumn 2007 .
An ambitious European territorial development policy based on massive investment will be one of the conditions to enable logistics operators to do their job properly at the best cost while respecting the environment .
in writing .
( SV ) - There is good reason to work together to create a smoothly functioning transport system between Member States with a view to promoting the internal market .
We do , however , question many individual points in this report .
We do not share the view that the common transport policy is under-financed and that the EU should invest further resources in this area .
We question the need for common training standards for the personnel involved in transport and logistics as we have every confidence in each Member State 's ability to manage this area satisfactorily .
Lastly , we believe that the Member States must decide independently whether or not 60 t goods vehicles may be permitted .
On account of these criticisms we have chosen to vote against the report .
in writing . - ( PT ) Although many other considerations deserve a mention with regard to this report , we should like to point out , in this explanation of vote , that we cannot understand why our proposed amendment , aimed at including a mention of the outermost regions - such as the Azores and Madeira - within the definition of the priorities for transport logistics in the various EU countries , was rejected .
Our amendments , which were rejected , placed the accent on :
the strategic importance of public services and their contribution to the public sector in promoting economic , social and territorial cohesion , and criticism of the policies that challenge the role of the State as a provider of public services ;
the incentive effect of public investments co-financed by the Structural Funds under the cohesion policy , which attract private investment and the possibility of using Community funding to finance private investment where there is no public investment strategy .
The rejection is all the more significant since the report notes that logistics is primarily a business activity , considering , however , that public authorities can play a role and act as facilitators and asking for the dissemination of best practice in financing logistics , for example , various initiatives using private-public co- financing .
A word to the wise ...
I voted in favour of this directive because it raises public awareness of the transport sector , in particular .
After all , transport logistics is a crucial factor in the development of European economic growth , competitiveness and quality of life , and also reduces environmental impact .
However , in my opinion , the statements on the authorisation of megaliners are out of place in this directive , as they are short-sighted and do not go far enough .
I voted in favour of the directive only in the hope that the Commission will take up this matter in the immediate future and regulate the area separately , at which point safety , environmental , transport and logistic aspects alike will have to be taken into account .
State-of-the-art knowledge will have to be utilised , as will politicians ' scope for laying down a strict framework for the use of such vehicles .
This could include rules on the use of Driver Assistance Systems such as brake assistants , lane departure warning systems , adaptive cruise control systems and camera monitors , or rules on steered axles and the distribution of driving power over several wheels .
Finally , we must not automatically associate the term ' megaliner ' with a maximum authorised mass of 60 tonnes .
It should be taken into account that megaliners with a maximum authorised mass of 44 tonnes actually reduce road congestion and bring enormous benefits to the economy , transport and the environment without harming the railways , which cannot even absorb the growth in demand for transport services .
While I am delighted about the adoption of the own-initiative report by Mrs Ayala Sender on logistics , which underlines the importance of intermodality for cleaner and more sustainable transport , I can only lament the adoption of paragraph 21 , against which I had already voted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
I voted against this paragraph because 60 t goods vehicles , to which this paragraph has just opened the door , are dangerous for the environment and for the users of our roads , which were not designed to carry these loads .
The road lobby 's arguments are fallacious : as the load capacities of current HGVs are already underused , the reduction in pollutant gas emissions that people are trying to lure us with on the basis of ' fewer vehicles for more transported goods ' is a trick .
As for the impact of these juggernauts on our infrastructure , it will eventually land on the shoulders of taxpayers by causing an explosion in road resurfacing budgets .
Finally , regarding road safety , apart from the risks posed by damage to infrastructure , the very size of these road-using monsters represents a danger for all other users .
in writing . - Although I will be supporting the Ayala Sender report because it contains a number of good and constructive suggestions as regards the technical subject of freight logistics , I do have some concerns .
One thing that concerns me is that the possibility of introducing 60-tonne mega lorries throughout Europe is a concept that I believe to be misguided and inappropriate when rail freight is at a low ebb , and when national infrastructures cannot sustain 60-tonne lorries it seems crazy to move away from present weight limits .
I appreciate that some countries already have 60-tonne lorries , which is why it is right to allow Member States to decide for themselves what their national weight limit should be .
However this should not be taken as giving a green light to 60-tonne lorries per se , nor should it be seen as a kind of ' thin end of the wedge ' scenario .
Sadly , Mrs Ayala Sender 's excellent report has been given an unjust hearing because members and the media have highlighted just one section of it - namely 60-tonne mega lorries .
It is right therefore to reiterate yet again that there will be no compulsion on Member States to introduce them on their national networks .
I am voting in favour of the report by Inés Ayala Sender on freight transport logistics in Europe - the key to sustainable mobility .
Mrs Ayala Sender has presented a very good report that provides a thorough analysis of this important issue .
Without an effective logistics sector , aims concerning growth , employment and increasing the attractiveness of the European Union for investors and employees - in other words , the main pillars of the Lisbon Strategy - cannot be achieved .
Logistics are an important element in the development of Europe and its competitiveness in the international arena .
Logistical activities taken as a whole constitute 13 % of GDP in the EU .
We should also bear in mind the enormous impact of the right logistical solutions in restricting environmental pollution , and how they help to limit energy consumption .
My view is that we should support a report that is aimed at helping to shape a plan of action in the area of logistics at European level .
I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , in which it says that the European Employment Services ( EURES ) network should become an important European labour market communication platform and a one-stop shop for workers ' geographical and occupational mobility .
This one-stop shop should aim to remove obstacles , especially arising from work-related social security questions , and to extend the knowledge of workers about their individual rights .
Geographical and occupational mobility is a crucial instrument for the success of the Revised Lisbon Strategy and more generally for the proper operation of the internal market on the basis of the social market economy .
It is an important challenge for the introduction of ' flexicurity ' approaches to employment , that is , approaches allowing greater flexibility in the management of human resources while providing the job security expected by our fellow citizens .
I voted in favour of the resolution on the EURES Activity Report 2004-2005 on the contribution of EURES to a single European labour market .
I believe that geographical and occupational mobility is a crucial instrument for the success of the Revised Lisbon Strategy .
In this regard , I consider that the European Commission should promote further the geographical and occupational mobility of workers through the increased budget line for 2007 in order to support projects in the area of transnational recruitment and cross-border partnerships .
The EURES network is presented as a possible European labour market communication platform , that is , as a factor which could help to encourage workers ' geographical and occupational mobility .
It should also help to address the present shortcomings in terms of information provided in order to avoid the horrific situations facing workers in various countries where they have to go in order to work , generally because of unemployment in their own country , as is the case with Portuguese workers .
We must improve information on social security and on workers ' rights with regard to holidays , pay , sickness benefit , housing benefit and benefits for education and training .
We need to ensure that the rights of workers going to work in a country other than their country of origin are duly recognised and upheld .
One serious issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of controls .
It is well known that workers are often required to work long hours , without proper housing , even with no contract of employment , and are paid much less than initially agreed .
These issues must be addressed if we are to achieve trouble-free worker mobility .
( CS ) I supported the report aimed at contributing to a reduction in alcohol consumption where it is excessive and hazardous .
I also support the 0.00 % limit but for professional drivers only .
I am against warning labels applied indiscriminately , as I consider it non-committal , as well as falling outside the EU 's competence .
I believe that it is the responsibility of the national parliaments to adopt such measures , not to be applied indiscriminately , not to be populist or non-committal , but rather aimed at educating targeted risk groups , threatened by excessive alcohol consumption .
( FR ) Mr President , the presentation of Mr Foglietta 's own-initiative report has provoked comments that could suggest that all members of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats underrate the serious problem of alcoholism .
I cannot approve of the casualness with which the problems of alcohol dependence are concealed out of reverence for the producers of alcoholic beverages and their lobbies .
The protection of young people deserves better , as does the treatment of alcoholism as a serious illness affecting everyone close to the person concerned .
In the end , this own-initiative report will do nothing to change the real situation .
in writing . - ( SV ) We have chosen to support the report in the final vote .
Nevertheless , we would have preferred to see stronger provisions on warnings on spirit bottles and on the risks of alcohol use by women during pregnancy .
It is regrettable that Parliament was not able to support the amendments and the parts of the existing text along those lines in the plenary .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by Mr Foglietta on a European Union strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm .
The Commission was right to issue a communication on the hazardous and harmful consumption of alcohol and its harmful health consequences . I support the recommendations , while not undermining the principle of subsidiarity , in favour of ambitious general objectives for the Member States with a view to curbing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption , particularly in vulnerable social groups , such as children , young people and pregnant women .
I am pleased that MEPs , in their wisdom , acknowledge that the consumption of alcoholic products can be considered as a part of the European cultural heritage and life style , and that low consumption of alcohol ( 10 g / day ) may , under certain conditions , help prevent some diseases .
in writing . - After tobacco and high blood pressure , alcohol abuse is the third most important cause of ill-health and early death in the EU , costing millions to our heath service .
Related road accidents continue to claim lives while related public order offences and underage drinking are on the rise across all of Europe .
The greatest tool of efficiency in decreasing alcohol-related harm is real awareness combined with enforcement .
Effective education in the home and in school from primary school up is paramount .
Women and men should be better informed about the risks of alcohol during pregnancy and about FASD in particular and I support the original language of the report emphasising the appropriate warning on the package of alcoholic beverages which may prevent women from drinking alcohol before and during pregnancy .
I call on the Irish government to examine mandatory labelling on alcoholic beverages targeting this syndrome .
I am very much in favour of asking the Commission to take steps to facilitate an independent study of the performance of innovative communication means , including labelling , as a way of reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption .
The June Movement supports warning labels on alcoholic beverages .
When these proposals return to Parliament , we shall work towards minimum labelling rules , so that Member States can legislate in line with the precautionary principle .
In my opinion , the problems associated with alcohol abuse are taking on worrying proportions in all EU Member States .
Beyond the traditional convivial consumption of alcohol , which varies from region to region and Member State to Member State , it is necessary to remember that regular , excessive consumption of alcohol has a harmful impact on health and serious , direct consequences : road accidents and antisocial behaviour .
Consequently , as a matter of urgency we need to remind alcohol producers and distributors of their responsibilities , to ask operators in the sector to provide the necessary support , to involve schools and families , to send out a message providing young people with positive examples and to increase awareness of risks among the more vulnerable sections of society .
in writing . - ( PT ) The report merely broaches , without going into detail , the central issue of the underlying reasons for alcohol abuse and therefore has the drawback of taking what we might call a cognitive / repressive approach based on the process of assessing the risk / threat / punishment balance .
It should be borne in mind that any addictive drug and any addictive behaviour have their own characteristics .
The report mentions the need for effective conclusions to be drawn based on collected data , but it seems to embark upon a road leading towards a foregone conclusion .
Before tackling the grand question of ' alcohol and the workplace ' we ought to be stressing the capital importance of role models in the formation of young people 's values and attitudes .
Even occupational health , which ought to play a central role here in prevention and therapeutic guidance , is seen as an extension of the repressive / exploiting arm of the employer rather than an independent mechanism for preventing health problems and promoting health .
A budgetary item should be created to fund programmes supporting workers who are suffering from workplace stress , excessive workloads , unemployment and job insecurity , directed at identifying and treating alcohol dependence , improving working conditions , preventing sickness and promoting health .
in writing . - ( SV ) The June List has chosen to vote against the report and several of the amendments .
Alcohol policy must be a national matter and cannot therefore be shaped at EU level .
Each Member State has its own drinking culture which must form the basis for its citizens ' work to reduce alcohol-related harm .
International advances are being made in this area , as in nearly all others , as countries find their way along different paths .
By learning lessons from the experiences of other countries , each country can then develop its own alcohol strategy in the best possible way .
Such institutional competition among countries is the reason for the European countries ' historical successes in nearly every area .
Parliament must not hamper that competition by pushing forward homogenisation at EU level .
I voted in favour of this report , which makes a number of concrete proposals to prevent alcohol abuse among vulnerable groups such as young people and pregnant women .
The report does not demonise moderate consumption of wine ( except in the specific case of pregnant women ) , which is part of our culture and traditions , but addresses alcohol abuse .
I am also delighted with the proposed measures to provide more information to pregnant women on the risks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy .
Alcohol consumption , even in small quantities , is harmful to the foetus .
Facial abnormalities , microcephaly , neurological problems with agitation , behavioural problems , cognitive problems or even mental retardation : these are some of the risks for the child .
Lastly , I am satisfied with the proposal to introduce appropriate communication directed at pregnant women through healthcare services .
We would all like to combat hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption , particularly by young people , whose latest fashionable excess is what the Germans call Koma-Saufen , a term well understood in my own country .
I recognise the European Union 's competence in dealing with public health problems and the role it has to play to encourage the exchange of information and best practices among Member States .
Unfortunately , the resolution only highlights the harmful consequences of alcohol and not the benefits of moderate consumption .
Indeed , it is scientifically proven that wine consumed in moderation has a preventive effect against cardiovascular diseases , cancer and dementia .
But this valuable information is prohibited on labels by European regulations .
Why warn women before and during pregnancy and ignore the effect of alcoholism on the men procreating ?
Why recommend higher taxes on alcoholic beverages when it is clear that alcoholism is worst in countries with very high taxes ?
I would like to underline the fact that there can be no question of setting EU level blood alcohol content limits for all drivers .
Zero tolerance of drivers who commit offences , whether or not drink-drivers , would be more effective in fighting the increase in the number of road accident victims .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the above-mentioned report and welcome the inclusion of an amendment to paragraph 16 , which I voted in favour of , highlighting the harmful effects of consuming alcohol during pregnancy .
Currently , Member States may use labelling to inform consumers about the potential negative effects of consuming alcohol , and this is something that the Irish government should certainly consider .
However , meaningful progress in terms of labelling can only be achieved through a degree of EU harmonisation in this area .
I look forward to the publication of the Commission 's study on the performance of innovative means of communication to reduce hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption before 1 January 2010 , as called for in the above-mentioned report .
in writing . - I supported this report and am pleased that there will now be a real effort to tackle under-age and binge drinking .
I support the recommendation also that the blood alcohol limit be as close to 0.00 % as possible especially for new drivers although I realise that a 0.00 % limit is impractical .
I believe that alcopops must be separated from soft drinks in supermarkets and I am pleased that the report highlights this .
It is all very well to legislate on milk , on its distribution in schools or the army , or on the creation of a new category , but the dairy sector is something else .
In the 1980s , the Commission in Brussels told us that there were milk lakes and butter mountains .
As with cereals , then , a policy of ' Malthusian bureaucracy ' was introduced .
Under the impetus of the French Agriculture Minister , Michel Rocard , milk quotas were invented .
That is , rationing , the deliberate fabrication of scarcity .
For the first time in the history of humanity , people were preventing themselves from producing , and were rejecting the riches offered naturally by nature .
Worse still , to be certain of achieving scarcity , we went as far as the daft premium for the slaughter of cattle .
What was bound to happen has happened .
The barriers to production have limited production .
From milk lakes to the Aral Sea of milk .
There is a shortage of butter .
Prices are rising .
This shortage was organised , in the same way as for wheat .
in writing . - Foetal Alcohol Syndrome ( FAS ) and Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder ( FASD ) need to be seriously considered as a matter of urgency .
FAS warnings on alcohol products , similar to those in the USA , combined with a public health education campaign are an effective way of warning of the impact of drinking while pregnant .
There is no safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and women deserve to know the facts .
The alcohol industry must act as a matter of urgency .
Also , all Members who have a financial interest in the alcohol industry should declare an interest .

Financial instability and the impact on the real economy ( debate )
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on financial instability and the impact on the real economy .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , as you would imagine , it is still too soon to evaluate the recent turbulence in the financial markets .
We must await more specific economic data and , as you know , the Council has not met since late July , but I agree with Mr Jean-Claude Juncker , President of the Eurogroup , when he said that for the moment there is no perceptible impact on the growth forecasts in the euro area as a whole .
The European economy has continued to show strong growth based on solid foundations .
In fact this year has shown very positive results in terms of reducing budget deficits , stability of the euro , economic growth and employment .
It is against that background that we must view the recent financial turbulence that I mentioned earlier .
That is all I have to say on the matter for now .
I am sure that the informal meeting of the Ecofin Ministers , to be held on 14 and 15 September , in the Portuguese city of Porto , will , as is customary at those Council meetings , analyse the economic and financial situation of the European Union in greater detail on the basis of much more complete and up-to-date data .
I should also like to assure you that the Portuguese Presidency will continue the work of consolidating a single market for financial services .
Also the continuing high investment in convergence of supervisory practices and constant improvement of the prudential framework clearly shows that we have not underestimated the importance of a framework which promotes financial stability .
Finally , in general terms , the Presidency is committed to continuing implementation of the Lisbon Agenda .
Implementation of that agenda is the best contribution we can make to strengthening the potential for growth in the European economy and maintaining solid foundations and the Portuguese Presidency remains strongly committed in that field .
Commission . - ( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in recent weeks there has been serious turbulence in the financial markets , initially caused by the deterioration in the US sub-prime mortgage market .
This deterioration extended to all the financial markets via securities and financial products supported by those mortgages , which , in recent years , have been acquired in large quantities by financial institutions almost throughout the world .
If we look at corrections to stock markets over recent weeks , they have not been greater than previous market corrections over the last two years ; however , what happened recently is unusual in that it gave rise to a liquidity crisis in the interbank markets , which obliged the central banks to inject large amounts of money .
The liquidity problems are clearly linked to a decline of confidence owing to a lack of information on the global exposure of market operators to the products linked to North American high-risk mortgages .
The impact of this turbulence could go beyond what we have seen so far and it therefore demands our full attention and fully justifies today 's debate .
It is still too early to quantify the consequences of this crisis on the real economy .
The final impact will depend principally on three factors .
Firstly , we will have to see what direct impact the deterioration in the North American housing market has on the overall US economy , although there is no doubt that it will be negative , and US growth will be lower than predicted up till now .
Given the influence of the US economy on the wider global economy , a slowdown in growth in the United States will have some impact on the rest of the world , in particular , on European economies .
This impact should , in principle , be limited , in our case , as EU countries mainly trade within the EU .
Moreover , the global economy continues to enjoy a high rate of growth , thanks to the dynamism of the emerging countries , among others .
Emerging countries have certainly not been greatly affected by this crisis .
The second relevant factor when evaluating the possible impact of the financial turbulence is the changes in financing conditions for businesses and households .
We are already seeing a re-evaluation of risk premiums to bring them more into line with the real assessment of that risk .
This is correcting a situation in which the abundance of liquidity had led to a degree of relaxation of risk assessment .
This has positive aspects , but if financing conditions were to be tightened beyond certain limits , economic activity would undoubtedly be affected by the reduced availability of capital .
The third factor , which is probably the most important and most difficult to predict , will be the impact on confidence .
Confidence is a key driver of investment and purchase decisions , but unlike the previous factors , it is a subjective value that is based on the overall messages , perceptions and information received by economic operators .
Among others , these include messages from the public authorities , whether national governments , parliamentary representatives or international organisations .
As I said before , the global economy is still extremely dynamic , and thanks to this there is still a trade surplus in the external sector of our economy , as demonstrated by the latest statistics published by Eurostat .
Investment , in particular in capital goods , remains at high levels , supporting current economic activity and anticipating future improvements in productivity .
Private consumption is benefiting from sustained job creation , so that our latest statistics show an unemployment rate in the euro area and in the EU that is almost comparable to historical lows : in the case of the euro area , unemployment is below 7 % .
Inflation remains stable .
Thanks to all this , companies are enjoying positive results , which should enable them to cope with any tightening of credit without having to significantly review their investment and growth plans .
Nevertheless we have good reason to remain confident about the foundations of the European economy and its capacity to overcome the current turbulence .
Next Tuesday , 11 September , on behalf of the Commission , I will publish the interim growth forecasts for 2007 both for the euro area and the EU , which will give us an initial indication of the possible impact of the crisis .
On the same day I will have the opportunity to present these forecasts to you when I appear before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
The forecasts for 2008 and beyond , as you know , will have to wait until we publish our economic forecasts in November , as usual .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , while the Council was not meeting , at least the European Central Bank , was at work and I think can be given some credit for having stemmed the possible further infection in Europe .
Let us hope it will continue to play that sensible , reasonable and sensitive role .
But every so often it seems that it is the inevitable fact of financial life that the chase after competitive advantage will lead to excesses , which in turn lead to the predictable bust .
These pressures are largely responsible also for the urge to develop these innovative financial instruments which Mr McCreevy described , and which lurk behind the development of this crisis in the American sub-prime mortgage market and its resulting transmission to Europe .
I do not see this situation as a justification for a witch-hunt on hedge funds .
To some extent they have been perhaps sophisticated , or naive , victims of these new-fangled alchemies .
In the same way , normally conservative but naive banks have been tempted by the enhanced interest rates paid by these supposedly high-rated instruments to go for what has obviously turned out to be too good to be true .
It seems that few operators in the financial markets , including , probably , few regulators , sufficiently understand these instruments , these credit derivatives , these collateralised debt obligations .
Even less do they fully understand the potential risks and implications .
So it is incumbent on the authorities both in the US and Europe - and I am glad to see that Mr McCreevy is going to take this particular aspect so seriously - that they all become more conversant with these mechanisms with their structuring and their slicing , how these slices are rated , valued , accounted , with their marketing , with their liquidity and tradability .
Innovation is as desirable in financial mechanisms as anywhere else .
This must not be inhibited but , when problems of this seriousness are likely to emerge , it is essential that managers and regulators shoulder their responsibilities to understand them fully and , if and where necessary , introduce the requisite restraints .
Mr President , the cost of August 's turbulence on the financial markets has not yet emerged .
The Commission - we have just heard - is expecting a negative impact on growth .
The real losses suffered by the banks and other financial players will become apparent when their annual accounts are drawn up .
According to Commissioner Almunia , we still lack information about the actual , overall exposure of all the players .
The fact that those who took risks that were too great are footing the bill is a salutary principle , but behind the speculative activism of the financial world , there are victims : the families caught in the trap of mortgage lending based on the promise of unlimited growth in the property market and small investors directed to risks that were undervalued by all those living off fat commissions , including the credit rating agencies .
The Socialist group has been asking for years for increased supervision of hedge funds and all the special instruments being endlessly multiplied by the markets .
As Carlo Ciampi maintains , the tumultuous development of derivative products is free from any kind of control .
Even the directors of major banks no longer understand these opaque instruments . The real risks , for example the property loans , are sliced up ad infinitum , and repeatedly included in investment fund products and stock exchange instruments , with the result that nobody can locate the original risk any more .
The market expects the central banks to come to the rescue of the speculators .
The ECB did in fact , in its role as lender of last resort .
One might therefore ask why the ECB has had to inject more capital than the Federal Reserve into the market when it suddenly became illiquid , even though the sub-prime crisis came from the United States .
Were the European banks more gullible ?
Did the supervisory authorities fail to do their job properly ?
The Socialist group demands that the Commission should learn lessons from the financial market , which has become too opaque and therefore extremely dangerous for the real economy .
( Applause )
Firstly , I would like to answer Mr Goebbels 's question about why the European Central Bank allocated more money than the US Central Bank .
It is because the EU economy is now the largest in the world .
This is a great challenge for us all .
The fact that the OECD and the European Commission assessed the potential outcomes of the financial problems in the market differently on the same day surprised and saddened me .
This means that the European Commission should probably adjust its economic assessment models , especially since they are likely to be based on mathematical methods .
It is worrying , as forecasting economic policy is a complicated matter and the instruments used must be flexible .
What should we do now when we meet new challenges ?
I would not like to comment here on the problems that arise ; my fellow members have done this so well .
I would just like to emphasise one point .
Firstly , the crisis occurred because of the aggressive monetary policy within the EU 's boundaries when it was attempted to solve the problems of the Internet bubble .
Thus we cannot influence various decisions of third countries .
We can strengthen the dialogue and cooperation with supervisory bodies , but the European Union faces a dilemma : a global merger of financial institutions is currently taking place and it is possible that we will no longer have a single market .
We will have a transatlantic market in the area of securities ; perhaps we will have some other market in the area of insurance .
This means that we need to decide whether we consider Europe to be a single market and require all agreements to be made at European level .
Can we accept pilot projects when one of our markets enters the world stage independently ?
We need agreement on this , otherwise it will be very difficult to manage this crisis .
I would like to emphasise one more thing .
Financial markets are under reconstruction .
We ourselves acknowledged the role of non-banking institutions in the SEPA Directive .
We need to admit that various Islamic banks and foundations are appearing and finally that trading networks are entering the financial market .
Thus the regulation of non-banking institutions is also necessary - common regulation , which would make the rules of the game the same for both banking and non-banking institutions .
This is today 's reality .
The third issue that I would like to emphasise is that I am worried that we use only risky models as a basis .
This principle of risk assessment has proved to be very subjective , and I therefore have doubts about the Solvency II and Basel II directives .
We cannot trust rating agencies ; we can criticise them , but the problem will remain .
We should trust market instruments - that is , liquidity .
If we cannot sell particular securities on the market or if they are rarely traded , no rating agency can evaluate them .
This should be properly understood and we need to reduce the dependence of our legislation on the opinions of rating agencies .
To conclude , I would certainly like to say that there is no need to rescue financial institutions .
I can say from my own experience after the financial crisis in Lithuania that when bankers spend a couple of weeks in prison they very quickly understand how to manage banks .
( The President cut off the speaker )
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I should like to ask the Commissioners for their response .
The events that took place in August in the sub-prime market highlighted a number of issues for all of us .
First of all , the globalised nature of the financial markets which we are now dealing with , and the issue of how quickly regulation or supervision can keep pace with the way new products are being developed and new ideas are being developed .
But it also brings to mind something an old farmer in West Cork in the south-west of Ireland once said to me : there is no such thing as an oil that can make your hair grow - apologies to those folically challenged within the Chamber ; there is no such thing as a pair of glasses that can let you see through clothes and , also , there is a fool born every day .
The reality is that the products made available were high risk , and no matter what anybody says , the idea of caveat emptor is one that should have been at the very core of any decisions with regard to banks or other funds that we were going to invest in these high-risk products .
It brings starkly into contrast the role of the credit-ratings agencies and their responsibility , not only with regard to the advice they give , but , in particular , regarding their informing us in a transparent manner as to whether they are representing these funds themselves or whether they are actually giving clear , independent advice .
Colleagues will remember that , a number of years ago , we discussed a directive on consumer credit , and the whole area of transparency and of having independent advice available to the consumers was one key element .
Now , it is laughable that some of the biggest financial institutions in the world - and some in Europe - who are the people who spend so much money on buying-in expertise and telling us in Europe how we should run our economies , can be the ones who are now caught because of their bad investment policy .
I congratulate Commissioner McCreevy on his willingness to take on this issue and to tackle some of these areas .
I also think it is essential now , not only in looking at credit-rating agencies , but also with regard to the risk that European banks are being exposed to because of the policies of some of those investments , and next week ...
( The President cut off the speaker )
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the crisis demands that I highlight three points .
First , it comes from a hardship crisis among North American national officials .
It should be understood that all US officials have very serious deficits , described by what we call the US twin deficits .
We have had this crisis , we will have others , either from large US companies , US states or even perhaps from the Federal Government .
We should expect some more very serious crises to come from the United States over the coming years .
Second , this crisis happened in the United States in March .
It spread throughout the world through hedge funds , the first two of which failed in June .
It only affected European banks in late July , early August .
We did have time to realise that the flames were spreading .
Mrs Merkel , our President-in-Office at the time of the G8 , told us to take measures concerning hedge funds , and nobody listened to her .
Worse still , the Netherlands are in the process of developing a policy to deregulate the establishment of hedge funds within the country .
At the same time as it is speaking against hedge funds , the European Union is encouraging their development in its own territory .
This shows a genuine failure of attempts by the European Union to impose supervisory measures and prudential rules upon itself .
As a former rapporteur in favour of prudential rules and supervision of financial conglomerates , I experience this as a personal failure .
I recall that we needed more than one parliamentary term to write the simplified prospectus on issuing securities in Europe .
Today , one bank is not capable of reading the complex prospectus that another bank publishes on the content of the funds it is selling .
That is what it has come to .
The third problem , as I told the Central Bank years ago , is that you cannot regulate the monetary system solely with measures aimed at the lending rate .
I think the crisis in Europe was precipitated by the increase in the European Central Bank 's interest rate at the end of the last quarter .
I do not think it is enough to say you should reduce the rate by 0.5 % or keep the same rate or increase it by 0.5 % .
We have a genuine problem to sort out , which is the reintroduction of a selective policy for lending , so that the interest rate can be set at 0 % for necessary investments such as fighting climate change and can be much more expensive for lending directed at speculation .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , I would like to address my remarks to the gallery , which is a lot more filled than this Hemicycle is with Members .
I hope you have got your headphones on because decisions are being made here today by people with absolutely no knowledge of international finance at all .
I have been 40 years in financial services ; I am a professional economist - we are talking about hedge funds , we are talking about international currency .
If you want to look up the books and see what expertise the Members of the European Parliament have , I think you will be bitterly disappointed .
But here we are , making decisions for global finance .
Forty percent of British GDP is the City of London .
We have people from Poland , the Czech Republic and Latvia who have absolutely no knowledge of these sorts of things whatsoever , deciding where we are going to go for the future in international finance .
( Uproar )
They do not understand about these things .
They do not know anything about these things , any more than they do about agricultural policy , fisheries policy - the lot - but here it is .
Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery , if you want to see international finance , go to Dubai , to New York , to Los Angeles , to Bermuda .
You are looking at the people down there - look at them .
None of them have ever done a real job in their lives .
This is a Mickey Mouse assembly , and we are going to lose the lot .
May I draw your attention to the fact that when you are speaking in the Hemicycle , you address the President and the Members , while those who are taking part in the session are the audience .
Please have respect for those who are showing you the respect of listening to you .
( applause )
on behalf of the ITS Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the collapse of the US market in high-risk loans has caused a splash that is still being felt on the stock markets today and which has thrown speculators and savers into serious crisis .
What the US real estate operators did is common knowledge : they offered loans , which were then defaulted on , to high-risk individuals , thus placing not only the financial products but also many banks in crisis .
This year a very high percentage of borrowers has stopped paying the instalments owed , placing the entire system in crisis .
In Italy , apart from the stock-market movements , it appears that the crisis has only had a slight effect on the national banking system because Italian banks , apparently , are not directly exposed to sub-prime loans .
This was not the case for many German , British and French banks and that is why we are having this debate today .
Therefore the least we can hope for is the opening of an enquiry into the largest international credit rating agencies on their role in these events and thus action on financial instability and on the impact on the real economy .
In the face of all this , listen to what L 'Espresso reveals about some Italian left-wing politicians - a fact that is worth emphasising - as well as some centrist figures , but above all left-wing ones .
These gentlemen , whose first and last names and addresses are listed , benefited from exceptionally favourable terms for purchasing property in Rome .
Recommendations , you may say , are a practice , perhaps an accepted practice , and perhaps an ancient practice , in my country - and not just in Italy , but perhaps worldwide .
However , when a recommendation is requested and the favour is obtained from a bank or insurance company , I ask myself , what is given in exchange by those in power ?
Democracy has its costs , you may say , and as the proletariat had its costs so today does progressive socialism , which has inherited from its predecessors the ability to be specific in the pursuit of its own interests .
You have only yourselves to blame , Italian and European citizens , if you have decided to do something other than pursue a career in one of the Italian parties that govern or have governed cities , regions and nations , and which in governing are governed by the banks .
( ES ) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioners , I would first of all like to express my thanks for the words of our authority figures regarding maintaining an optimistic stance in the face of the crisis that we are experiencing .
At the same time , however , I would also like to bring as much realism as possible to this debate , as concealing the seriousness of the facts will only lead to confusion when it comes to seeking solutions .
Firstly , we are facing a crisis that was predicted .
We are not facing a surprise crisis .
It was known that this would happen at least one year before , and there has been a lack of care , a lack of capacity to react .
Secondly , we are facing a serious crisis .
The President of the Bundesbank said so himself just over three days ago .
We may be on the verge of a classic banking crisis of withdrawal of confidence .
Thirdly , Europe has been infected by financial institutions in countries that have been unable to make profits because their economies were relatively stagnant , and have therefore sought profit at a greater risk .
It could therefore be said that the supervisory authorities , the European prudential authorities , have failed to prevent this from happening .
The European Central Bank is therefore the first to intervene in the crisis , the one that is injecting the most money , precisely because it is in Europe , in the heart of Europe , which is now recovering economically , where this crisis could become most serious .
We therefore need more clarity as to what the actual repercussions are and how major this crisis really is .
Undoubtedly the fourth characteristic of what we are experiencing , the circumstances that we are in , is , in short , the reaction of our monetary authorities , the reaction of the European Central Bank .
In my opinion , it acted correctly when it made these injections of liquidity , because what we are seeing is a withdrawal of liquidity .
However , it is also true that it is paradoxical that this should happen precisely when Europe is raising interest rates in order to restrict the liquidity of the system , to restrict credit .
This is a major paradox that needs to be explained properly , without the confusion that arose from the explanations given throughout August .
Clarification is essential , because we are talking about millions of families and millions of small and medium-sized enterprises , which depend on variable interest rates in Europe , getting into debt .
Therefore , it is essential that we clarify the interest rate scenario and ask for caution in interest rate rises in Europe , in order to strengthen the economic growth and job creation that we need so much at this stage of EU integration .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we must be realistic : despite being the powerful European legislator that we are , we will not be able to do anything about the origin of this crisis .
We are powerless against US legislation that fails to understand consumer protection in mortgage lending , whether by banks or by other institutions .
Let us be realistic : we are facing a crisis of which we urgently need to correct the effects , but also learn the long-term lessons .
Let us be clear : our European citizens are , quite rightly , worried about the consequences of this crisis for the financing of the real economy .
Let us be clear : our fellow citizens do not understand that , to cope with the risk-taking of a few , whose method of remuneration does not follow any economic logic , public institutions like the European Central Bank are at the end of the day forced to intervene to guarantee the liquidity of the market .
Let us cope with the situation .
Let us stand where Europeans should stand , grounded in realism and proposals .
In the end the Central Bank did its job as lender of last resort .
However , as a supervisory body , it is powerless to find out the reality of the risks taken by the market players .
We must improve the supervisory powers of the European authorities , and it is your job , Commissioner , to play an active part in this too .
Let us cope with the situation : we have been talking for many years about fair value , and this same fair value has today worsened the conditions for valuing sub-primes .
Let us cope with the situation : as regards the credit rating agencies , the IOSCO code of conduct , Commissioner , does not meet the demands of the current situation .
We need a truly competitive market , in which there are no conflicts of interest and which is characterised by greater transparency .
Finally , let us be utopian and hope that the use of the financial bubble created in this way will finally start to release finance for the long-term investment Europe needs to cope with the climate and energy challenge .
Sometimes utopia can be the best form of realism .
- ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we find ourselves in this Parliament facing once again a problem we faced back in July .
At that time , some uncertainties were expressed concerning the crisis which was then about to strike the euro area .
This was a crisis foretold , as indicated by the news coming from the USA .
It had already been clear for some time that property prices in the USA were excessively inflated and that the US system allowed loans to be granted too easily to insolvent persons , or to be granted at very high interest rates , and the resulting turbulence in the global market was inevitable .
Who has played a part in this game ?
Investors , citizens , mainly from the US but also Europeans , are suffering its negative impact ; citizens and investors , savers .
Thus the question is whether this Chamber , and the institutions in general , have the protection of savers at heart .
Protecting savers means understanding the role played by the other operators within this framework or in this scenario , the role of the credit rating companies , which often display a great inconsistency and have conflicts which at times go unchallenged .
I believe that rules and standards ought to apply to all of this .
The crisis has also highlighted a marked contradiction at a time in which the ECB has been forced to make financial movements in the market and at the same time to raise interest rates to tackle the risk of inflation .
Let us hope that this situation will not persist .
The fact that this is happening , however , means that we must ask ourselves how the standards governing persons on the world stage - since this is a crisis which has once more highlighted the aspect of globalisation - ought to define the conduct of every person .
( LV ) Mr President , the current financial instability should not have come as a surprise , but when it materialised , everyone was shocked .
Insecure consumer and property loans gave rise to a growing demand for liquidity .
Market corrections are occurring because for a long time money has been too cheap , and this has eroded standards for evaluating investments .
A lack of confidence in the market has damaged even attractive assets , which ought not to have been subject to the downward price correction .
We can now be sure that easily accessible , cheap money does not create stable growth .
The foundation for stable growth is the proactive reform of systems , effective investments and markets that function more freely and more transparently .
At the moment the main fears revolve around the liquidity crisis turning into an insolvency crisis .
Instability that starts off in the form of a liquidity crisis can degenerate into an insolvency crisis , since market participants , convinced that their level of knowledge is inadequate , will be unwilling to lend to each other .
The property crisis may create serious complications in several EU Member States , not just in the United States .
Investors and depositors will not recover confidence in the financial market until they are convinced that evaluations are correct .
This means that risk premiums may increase , and as a result company and household consumption will decrease .
This could reduce investment movements or , in some cases , even bring them to a halt .
Europe 's fiscal and monetary policy makers must be ready for this .
The main responsibility for stabilising the situation will fall to fiscal policy makers .
In the monetary policy sphere we can expect lower interest rates , which many European politicians have been longing to see .
At the same time the market should not harbour the misleading belief that risky investments will remain .
Both loan rates and demands for collateral should reduce the moral damage that such a belief could create .
In the long term , the central banks need to improve regulatory mechanisms for the financial markets in order to establish greater clarity and certainty within them .
Thank you .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the full extent of the instability sensed on the global financial markets is not yet clear .
The weak points of global finance are the poor creditworthiness of borrowers on the US mortgage market and the errors made in assessing credit risks of assets and / or in auditing these .
We could ask what happened to Basel II in this phase in the United States ; I realise that it has not been brought in yet , but it would have been helpful .
In the United States , a mortgage volume of USD 120 billion has been adjusted up to now .
This fact alone has triggered rate-adjustment shock of the proportions known .
Approximately 700 billion more mortgages are to be adjusted in the next two years .
Heightened investor sensitivity has exacerbated the dilemma , with confidence and the appetite for high-risk investments down .
Even boards of directors of banks are now admitting that they did not know what they were doing .
Lack of investor confidence and realistic assessments are currently preventing a return to normal levels - a process that will undoubtedly take some time and will not even spare the professionals of banking supervisory bodies .
Confidence cannot be expressed statistically by mathematical formulae .
However , transparency builds and maintains confidence and facilitates risk control .
Commissioner , you mentioned Solvency II .
The risks from hedge funds and sub-prime mortgages have tended to be low thus far in the insurance sector ; and that is the way it should stay .
That is why Solvency II is intended to provide the right starting points and incentives .
Under the present proposals , alternative investments such as hedge funds and asset-backed securities , which are often also exposed to sub-prime risk , will be subject to own-capital backing of 45 % as a standard consequence of Solvency II .
This may seem high at first glance , but it provides a clear incentive for enterprises to push an envisaged hedge fund to disclose its investment to the investor .
In my opinion , one principle applies here , and that is that only those who have the necessary know-how themselves should be making higher-risk capital investments .
The European Parliament has long been calling for transparency in specific financial products and mechanisms .
A response by the Commission to the creation of further transparency rules for the 9 000 and more existing hedge funds is overdue .
Transparency rules for credit rating agencies are also needed .
A more realistic assessment of global credit risk would benefit both .
Over the past few years , European budgets and the economy have been incurring multiple debts .
The sin of taking out loans at enticingly low rates of interest automatically produces imbalances between monetary and real-economy performance .
Mr President , there is a lot to say about this financial crisis , but I will use my two short minutes to focus on three areas where I think we need to take action .
The first is the lack of regulation .
Several members have said this already .
Complex new products , and particularly the diversification and securitisation of risks , is something which is a key element in this crisis .
It was sold to us as a perfect method to get rid of risks , but it is now clear that diversification has also meant a proliferation of risks and of the insecurity that is now everywhere .
The second element concerning regulation is that these operations largely take place outside the regulated market : over-the-counter activities and hedge funds , as has been mentioned already .
I really think that we have to investigate where these blind spots are leading .
I know Mr McCreevy does not agree , but I think it is really high time now to look into possibilities of regulation - not to over-regulate , not to panic , but really to conduct a serious study .
That is what the Commission should do .
Another element is the lack of information and transparency .
This has also been mentioned by several people .
I want to mention the ratings agencies as well , and the accounting rules which Mrs Berès also mentioned - the fair value issue .
This is linked to my third point , which is the lack of coordination and cooperation .
That is an element which we have seen now in the actions that have been undertaken by the ECB , which correctly provided liquidity but did not have the information and does not have the tools to punish those who caused the crisis .
There should be a much closer link between the ECB and its knowledge and the supervisors .
A very important element is cooperation and the strengthening and reinforcing of European-level supervision , which really has a grip on these phenomena at the top of the market and these new phenomena .
I have mentioned several times that we need such European-level supervision .
People then tell me , even if they agree , that you have to wait for a crisis to appear because the sense of urgency is not there .
I think now it is high time , and the crisis is there , so now we should act .
( SV ) Mr President , this summer 's financial unrest has clearly shown how closely integrated the markets are .
The global financial market literally runs around the clock , with millions of transactions that affect us all .
New technologies create entirely different conditions .
The possibility of creating better prospects for development in investment has increased dramatically .
Access to venture capital is vital here .
Many new financial instruments , which some have called into question today , have been largely good and increased liquidity and investment opportunities .
During the turbulent past few weeks on the financial markets it has been shown that it is good that Europe has a strong central bank .
The ECB was able to act more quickly than its counterpart in Washington and could take rapid action to calm the markets .
For that the ECB deserves praise .
We still do not know how far the US mortgage crisis will continue to spread .
The autumn will be crucial as new statistics emerge .
Hopefully there will be a normal market adjustment without any great convulsions that might affect the regional economy , which is essentially healthy within the European Union .
I hope - unlike some of my fellow Members here , obviously - that in Europe we do not overreact and think that the solution always demands more regulation and decisions taken in too great haste , as Mr McCreevy said .
Despite the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act , with extensive regulation , the risky mortgages were not discovered in time .
A smoothly functioning financial market requires a balanced approach , and space for new methods combined with legislation that strengthens the interests of consumers .
I think that MiFID is a good example here .
For me as a liberal , openness and transparency are key in the financial markets .
I would also like to see more cooperation between the EU 's financial authorities to combat crisis situations and to provide a rapid response .
Mr President , Commissioners , I must make one comment : when things are blowing up around the world , it is clear that a small currency and a small market like Sweden 's are hit lightning-fast .
The events of the summer have given me further reason for Swedish entry to the euro .
- ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the grave spectre of the debacle resulting from the sub-prime loans also hangs over European banks .
Many of their management funds irresponsibly stuffed themselves with derivative products .
There is a serious risk of contagion via private equity .
The banks have irresponsibly palmed mortgage bonds off on institutional investors and thus also on savers , presenting them as having a triple A rating - theoretically risk-free like national securities - instead of at a very high risk of default , like negative equity loans .
Speculation , set free to lord it over the globalised financial market , has led small savers to believe that derivatives are the philosopher 's stone of the third millennium .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
This chain of events is definitely not over and those who are really responsible remain unpunished - the hidden schemers of high finance .
Here speakers have been restricting themselves to pointing the finger of blame at the credit rating companies , but why have we permitted the assessment and control of the riskiness of financial products to be entrusted to companies closely involved with and with an interest in the growth of a market that is under the intoxicating influence of speculation ?
Please , have the courage to face it clearly : not only is the improper use of derivatives harmful , but the derivatives are harmful in themselves .
Pietro Lombardo came not by usura , Duccio came not by usura , nor Pier della Francesca , Zuan Bellin ' not by usura , nor was ' La Calunnia ' painted .
Came not by usura Angelico .
Usura rusteth the chisel , it rusteth the craft and the craftsman .
Usura slayeth the child in the womb , it stayeth the young man 's courting , it hath brought palsey to bed , lyeth between the young bride and her bridegroom . '
Usury is not the way to govern the world , to protect the widespread interests of honest people who work , produce and save .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Mr President , this financial crisis is a wake-up call for all of us and also for Commissioner McCreevy .
Only a few months ago Mr McCreevy assured us that the talk about financial risks and crises was theoretical and we would never run into new bubbles .
Now we have just been confronted with one , which has serious consequences , according to today 's Financial Times , the OECD and other qualified institutions .
I have four questions for Mr McCreevy .
Firstly , if we look at the derivatives - credit derivatives , credit market - you blame the agencies and say that they are not good enough ; I say that we do not know anything about what is going on .
Are you ready now to propose a public classification of the complex derivatives in such a way that the public and private agencies can give us guidance on the risk connected to them ?
Because that is impossible today .
My second question is about the conflict of interest .
If we take the prime brokers , the hedge funds and private equity funds , we see that they are mixed up in a complex set of interests : they earn income from each other , they trade with each other and we do not know what is going on .
Are you ready now to introduce rules of transparency , disclosure and accountability which give us a real chance of regulating the market ?
My third question concerns pension funds .
We know that wage-earners and workers are having losses connected to putting money into hedge-fund speculating in this derivative market .
Are you ready to introduce rules which can protect the pension funds and insurance companies trying to administer wage-earners ' money in the future so that they have an interest in saving and knowing that the losses are limited ?
My final question is : how can you defend the fact that the hedge funds , private equity and investment banks are the last resort on the international and financial markets without any regulations ?
We have the usage to regulate the banks and the mutual funds , why should they - hedge funds , private equity , investment banks - be the last resort ?
I cannot explain it , you cannot explain it .
It is time to put the common interests at the front , and that is why we need regulation .
( Applause )
( ES ) Mr President , following the storm , the skies have not yet cleared , and in the midst of the uncertainty there is a demand for economic stability , financial security , growth and job creation .
This crisis is a great opportunity to take action in four major areas .
Firstly , we need to act to limit its impact on the economy as a whole .
The market has reacted with turbulence in share prices and a tightening of financial conditions .
The European Central Bank 's response of providing liquidity was a positive one .
Financial institutions have already increased their interest rates to their clients , in anticipation of the predicted rises within a few months , taking into account the growth of the economy and the announcements made by the European Central Bank .
I hope that the European Central Bank will act in a balanced , prudent manner for our economy .
Secondly , we need to act to improve risk management and economic governance .
There is symmetry between a global financial services market and a national regulation and supervision system .
If within the European Union we do not promote these objectives in an integrated way , we will not be able to put them forward at global level , and we will not be protecting our citizens or defending their interests .
Thirdly , we need to act to make the market more transparent .
The diversification and dispersal of risk can be positive if it does not prevent risks from being controlled in the market .
We need to adopt measures in order to map out financial risks .
Finally , we need to act to make the operators more responsible .
Trapping people with limited resources into debt with very expensive mortgages that could even be described as predatory during a period of interest rate rises and the end of the growth trend in the property market is bound to generate problems .
The banks that relaxed mortgage conditions because of the possibility of transferring those mortgages , the rating agencies that did not warn about the quality of the securities , the investors that purchased securities imprudently and the institutions that financed them without additional guarantees all have a responsibility , and we need to make sure that this does not happen again .
Mr President , the process of sub-prime lending has definitely been a huge problem causing the financial turbulence which we have witnessed this summer .
That was clear , but what is less clear is the identification of investors and counterparties which may be , and continue to be , under stress , and that identity is absolutely vital for us to clear up .
This is due by and large , as we have heard today , to the sophistication of financial instruments which are viewed by some as akin to alchemy .
However , we need to take a careful and cautious look at what to do about these and the effects that have been caused by that turbulence .
Over-reaction may be equally as damaging as what has already occurred , as we find the price of credit rising as a result .
This is not good for the Lisbon Process , we should be reminded .
So what has actually happened in the USA to close the door on some of these issues ?
It might be said that the barn door has just been closed when the horse is in the field , and that would be true to say .
However , largely speaking , the sub-prime mortgage lending area was unregulated .
That is a fact now which has been addressed very directly as industrial regulatory and legislative initiatives , I am told , are under way .
At the same time , a high level working group has been set up under the auspices of the White House to look at credit rating agencies and sophisticated financial vehicles .
What we can draw from that is that it is vital to work closely with the United States and other global markets as we share the same conclusions about the transparency in these markets .
If we do not , because the global markets are intertwined so closely , we will stand to lose so much of the benefit that could be added by the conclusions which we would have to share .
What has happened within the EU and what has happened within the US ?
I share some confidence now in the Commission , and of course with the ECB as well as with the Federal Reserve in the United States , in what they have done .
They have helped to settle down the markets , which was exactly what we needed to do .
I can agree , however , with some of the speakers here today on calling for proportionate responses and I can maintain that in the sense of the confidence that I have .
I believe that the securitisation and special purpose vehicles , which will be under scrutiny along with the credit rating agencies , do need to be opened up to greater scrutiny and transparency , that is clear , as Ms Berès has already said .
But let us be clear that the sophistication of financial instruments is difficult for many of us to understand , and the role of credit rating agencies is open .
( The President cut off the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , as Europeans , our share of investment in the market we are discussing today is nearly 10 % , or approximately EUR 300 billion .
We do not know what exact proportion of this EUR 300 billion consists of bad risks , but EUR 300 billion is no trifling sum : it represents nearly three times the EU 's annual budget , and the impact of the current crisis can already be felt .
In my home country , Germany , the largest economy in the European Union , our expectations of future business conditions have been revised downwards .
Three-month funds have become significantly more expensive , which means that enterprises that are healthy but require intermediate financing can expect difficulties .
I should like to know what lessons we have learnt from this .
Almost all the speakers in this debate have mentioned credit rating agencies .
As a citizen interested in the state of affairs in this discussion , I found the following on the Internet , referring to a speech given by Commissioner McCreevy in Dublin on 5 April 2005 :
" Credit rating agencies will not be subject to EU regulation for the present , said Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy in a speech in Dublin on 5 April 2005 .
Commissioner McCreevy said he did not intend to issue specific regulation for credit ratings agencies ( CRAs ) but the possibility would be kept under " continual review " .
He warned that he was putting the industry " on watch " . ”
( DE ) Commissioner , when will the observation phase come to an end , when will we be ready to act ; when will we be in a position to cast some light into the black box of credit rating agencies , so that we are able to draw up a public scoreboard of their performance and errors ?
Our system is self-referential , ineffectual and clearly a legacy of previous times .
I should like an honest answer .
We cannot appear before the public at the next elections in 2009 and say : we did have a Commission ; it spent five years doing a great job of observing where the problem lay .
( DE ) Mr President , that was a clear enough message to the Commission .
We can already foresee that the US mortgage crisis will have noticeable adverse effects here , too .
The volume of outstanding mortgage loans already exceeds US public debt .
Even speculation based on future property appreciation and low interest rates on mortgage loans has clearly proved to be a bubble .
Now , fears of recession are being voiced ever louder in the United States .
After all , eight out of ten recessions start with a property crisis .
We now know that the crisis was foreseeable but that credit rating agencies did not carry out their role of watchdog .
High-risk forms of capital are capable of doing all of us and the economy very great harm and thus must not be left to their own devices or to speculators .
The principles of transparency and duty of disclosure , and also controls , must be guaranteed .
The Commission is now required to present proposals on this .
( FR ) Mr President , this crisis is the third major crisis in 10 years .
Could it have been avoided ?
Mr McCreevy tells us it could .
To do this , we would need to teach the poor not to borrow money when they have none .
What is the reality ?
US sub-prime mortgage lenders are the main culprits and players in this crisis .
To increase their profits , they have turned to households in great financial difficulty .
In 2006 , half of the loans granted were made without a check on income .
These lenders have earned money with loans that should never have been made .
They have been supported by their banks ; however , these are controlled by their board of directors , auditors and regulatory authorities .
That has not prevented the banks from lending money to credit agencies , or from selling their customers lucrative though risky financial products on the back of this mortgage lending .
These securities , backed by the sub-prime market , were bought on a massive scale by hedge funds mostly domiciled in tax havens , which are exempt from any regulation .
So it is the whole control and supervision chain that failed .
My question is simple . What serious initiatives is the Commission now going to take to prevent the rush of the financial markets to the American property market from happening with new assets tomorrow , ending up with the same results : a stock market crisis then loss of growth ?
( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , financial crises are never confined to the financial sphere .
The current crisis will have the effect of further restricting credit and it has already started to push prices up in anticipation , irrespective of the decision the Central Bank takes tomorrow .
The confidence of economic operators has also fallen substantially and , despite the optimism of Commissioner Almunia , economic growth is neither generalised nor guaranteed .
There are even many regions with serious economic difficulties .
Today it is difficult , but I should like to know how to explain to citizens that the alarming increase in household indebtedness , the disincentive for public investment , the over-estimation of exports of goods produced in Europe due to interest rate management , among other factors , are inevitable sacrifices .
That was the traditional remedy for controlling non-existent inflation .
Nowadays the options are more limited for dealing with the perfectly predictable results of excessive risk taking by financial operators , and which we could not or would not regulate in time .
I think there are two conclusions to be drawn .
Firstly , there is a need for improved regulation , transparency and cooperation in the financial markets , as has already been mentioned .
Secondly , there is an urgent need to review the relationship between monetary policy and its impact on the real economy , families , investment and employment .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall be very brief , particularly since I already stated the Council 's basic position on this matter in my first speech .
I should like now to thank everyone here for all the speeches and suggestions you have made and to say that I have taken note of them and of your concerns , particularly those of what I would call a more social nature , that is , the possible consequences that the recent financial turbulence might have for citizens .
We shall keep that point in mind as a concern voiced by several Members .
I should like to reaffirm that we , as the Presidency and as the Council , shall continue to work on the convergence of supervisory practices and also on the schemes and mechanisms that will make it possible to constantly improve the prudential framework .
Both the Council and the Commission mentioned here that all the data available at the moment indicate that we have achieved our economic and financial objectives : deficits , economic growth and employment too are on the increase .
We are remaining totally realistic about this , however and - since realism has been mentioned here - I should like to say that the Presidency and the Council will be realistic .
We shall pay attention to all these matters , to the developments which the future might bring , and the Presidency and the Council , as it behoves them and where justified , will not fail to take the appropriate action and initiatives to provide a response to any misgivings and problems which might arise .
A large proportion of the results for 2007 are already guaranteed by the results produced in the first two quarters , by the information available on what is happening in our economies in this third quarter and by the positive inertia of economic recovery based on the good , solid foundations that we inherited from 2006 .
The risks will be more evident looking towards 2008 .
In our forecasts in May the growth rates for 2008 were already affected by a maturing of the economic cycle and by the impact of the decisions adopted on monetary policy by the central banks .
In Europe and beyond , this financial crisis , this financial turbulence and the subsequent tightening of credit conditions are going to increase or are increasing the risks of a decline in results for 2008 , but I still think that it is too early to make a definitive analysis from which to draw some final conclusions on the subject .
We need to hope that , insofar as many of the factors that have been encouraging the turbulence of recent weeks are related to confidence , if we recover confidence and if we all contribute to a rigorous vision and diagnosis of the situation in order to improve confidence , or to consolidate confidence , the 2008 results will be better or less concerning than some imagine they will be .
I think that most of those who have spoken broadly agree on what led to this increase in volatility and to the turbulence in the financial markets , and I also think that there is agreement that solutions need to be found .
However , the solutions are not simple , and we should not overact .
Just like good actors in the theatre , good politicians should not overact at times of turbulence .
We need to do more detailed analysis and understand the facts more fully , and we need to try to seek effective solutions to challenges that exist , those that are evident , and those that we have not yet discovered .
If we look back over the debates in Parliament or the reports on financial stability by the Monetary Fund or the Central Bank , the analyses by the European Commission and our own speeches in the recent past , we did not know where or when , but we did know that turbulence of this kind could occur , given the evolution of the financial markets , and the sophistication of the instruments and techniques used by financial institutions .
I repeat what I said at the start : the European economy is still on solid foundations .
The euro is protecting us .
Once again it has proven its ability to protect and to absorb shocks that under other circumstances , before the launch of the euro , would have created much greater difficulties for us , both from a monetary and financial point of view and in our real economy , and , to finish , I think that the European Central Bank , in exercising its responsibility , acted sensibly and correctly in August .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I shall be brief .
I fully agree that we cannot be complacent about the supervisory challenges that are presented by increasingly complex financial products and off-balance sheet vehicles .
Neither can we be naive and believe that Basel I , Basel II and Solvency II will solve the problems that have occurred .
There are important lessons to be drawn , which I will be taking up with all concerned in the time ahead .
As I said in my opening remarks , I believe a light-touch , principles-based regulation is the best approach .
I am certain that more regulation now would be the worst thing we could do for financial markets .
In any event , I do not believe that there is a need for more regulation .
It might surprise Mr Rasmussen to know that I agree with something he has advocated , i.e. more transparency .
However , there are other ways of achieving this than through regulation .
The debate is closed .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( PT ) This debate was intended to clarify the essential issue of the moment , that is the reason for this situation of financial instability .
It is not enough to identify the problem after it has already become apparent .
It is even less helpful to propound remedies , which in practice serve only to alleviate certain consequences for the moment but which , in the short and medium term , will not change anything .
We all know that the real economy is based on production , distribution and the consumption of goods in accordance with people 's needs , whether those needs be real , imagined or created by advertising .
That means that the money in circulation ought to match that real economy ; and yet the greed of those who want ever higher earnings has led to the creation of stock exchanges and speculative profits in a type of casino economy , putting the production sector in second place and encouraging financialisation of the system .
That is the root of the current problem which the central banks are trying to alleviate by placing even more money in circulation or putting up interest rates .
These processes have their limitations and run the risk of creating new speculation bubbles or of further damaging the real economy , thus increasing costs for families .
Convention to Combat Desertification ( debate )
The next item is the debate on
the oral question to the Council on the Objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification to be held in Madrid , from 3 to 14 September 2007 , by Miroslav Ouzký , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0140 / 2007 ) , and
the oral question to the Commission on the Objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification to be held in Madrid , from 3 to 14 September 2007 , by Miroslav Ouzký , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0312 / 2007 ) .
author . - ( CS ) Mr President , first of all I would like to apologise to the interpreters , as I have not prepared anything in writing and I therefore was not able to provide them with a written text of my contribution in advance .
I will , however , do my best to speak slowly and concisely , as the issue I am about to address is , in itself , clear .
As the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I would like to commend the Portuguese Presidency for having set as one of the main goals of its programme the issue of desertification and water shortage .
That is also why I particularly welcome the upcoming conference , mentioned earlier .
You are well aware of the fact that this Parliament and the EU as a whole has adopted climate change as one of the principal challenges for the period ahead and it is well known that water shortage and advancing desertification are incontrovertible consequences of climate change .
I am amongst those who are convinced that we should be preparing for the impact of climate change , rather than desperately attempting to arrest it , because our efforts in that direction are likely to fail .
Today we know as a matter of certainty that Europe , particularly its southern regions , will have to cope with water shortages and soil degradation .
Climatological debates teach us that atmospheric water loss causes further desertification , which in turn is responsible for further climate warming .
Breaking out of this vicious circle will prove to be very difficult .
My question to the Commission and the Council on behalf of my committee is as follows : what are the practical steps that the Commission and the Council aim to take ?
Is it clear today what can be done at Member State level and what can be done at European level ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Ouzký , first I should like to thank you for referring to the Portuguese Presidency 's programme on the environment , specifically on issues relating to drought and desertification .
That is actually one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency and I should now like to point out the results obtained in that area at the informal Council of Environment Ministers held recently in Portugal .
I shall not read all of the points in the Presidency 's conclusions on the matter .
I do however regard them as very interesting and important and would therefore call your attention to those conclusions , in particular as regards combating drought and the relationship between drought and the environment , and the measures which we could and should take in order to tackle this growing problem .
I should like also to mention in greater detail the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification , which is also an important feature of this session ; that Conference , as you know , is being held now , from 3 to 14 September in Madrid .
On 23 July the Council approved the conclusions setting out the European Union 's priorities - those that the EU must uphold at that Conference of the Parties , which is the eighth conference since the Convention was approved .
You will know that the Council supports the adoption , by this eighth Conference of the Parties , of the Ten-Year Strategic Plan and Framework to Enhance the Implementation of the United Nations Convention drawn up by the Intersessional Intergovernmental Working Group , and we are eager to see it implemented .
We are aware that civil society has an important role to play in this context , especially at local level , and we are in favour of that ; we must therefore encourage greater participation by all civil society actors in the implementation or in the process of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .
You will also know that the Conference of the Parties is to place the emphasis on the relationship between poverty and desertification to pinpoint how the Convention might contribute to combating poverty in close cooperation with other relevant world and regional actors .
The Council considers that it is important to reach a consensus on an improved system for monitoring the Convention based on standards for the conservation , management and sustainable use of dry areas .
Such a system will make it possible to measure past and present progress .
The Committee on Science and Technology has an essential role to play in improving the Convention 's knowledge base and making it possible to adopt measures and decisions on a more sound foundation .
The Council of the European Union considers that the challenges of desertification , climate change and biodiversity are complementary to one another and must be approached in a coordinated manner , with appropriate policies in order to develop synergies and make them more effective .
The Council also thinks that other vitally important factors are the availability of adequate financial resources , efficient management and the financing of initiatives to combat desertification , as well as an active and efficient Convention Secretariat .
Drought , like desertification , is also a serious cause for concern .
The Council is firmly convinced that these threats - drought and desertification - can be tackled effectively only through close international cooperation .
The European Union is therefore pursuing its objectives in this field in collaboration with third countries .
I would remind you in this context that , at its annual meeting held on 25 May this year , the ACP-EC Council of Ministers adopted a joint statement on combating drought and desertification .
That joint statement by the ACP countries and the European Union acknowledges the importance of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification for reducing poverty and for pursuing the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations .
The statement also supports adoption by the Conference of the Parties of the Ten-Year Strategic Plan and urges all the parties to work together to make the United Nations Convention more effective .
We therefore think it is very important to set a limited number of priorities as regards implementation selected on the basis of scientific data and to use indicators in order to measure the progress made .
Greater participation by civil society , on the other hand , and improved communication and broader dialogue between all actors will , in our view , also contribute - and significantly so - to the effectiveness of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .
Commission . - ( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Community has attached great importance to the role of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in alleviating poverty ever since it was signed in 1994 .
The Convention was developed as a principle tool to help achieve the objective of sustainable use of soil , in order to combat hunger and poverty .
The Commission still considers this Convention to be a key part of the fight against poverty and desertification ; the Convention is still a unique forum , with the necessary competence and experience to learn lessons and design new approaches to tackling soil deterioration , and has achieved a great deal but , as we are all aware , there is still much to be done .
The current work of the Convention is focused on key issues in the implementation of actions , such as integration and coherence , within strategic frameworks for cooperation .
The countries affected , as well as the donor countries , need to ensure that the development of the Convention is closely linked to other key development initiatives and , in particular , they need to ensure that the country concerned owns the process and runs it itself .
With regard to the European Union objectives for the conference to be held in Madrid , firstly , the Commission is particularly pleased that four members of the European Parliament are part of the Community delegation to the conference .
The Convention is entering its second decade and needs to adapt itself in order to respond to new challenges and take advantage of new opportunities .
This means reviewing measures that are taken through the Convention , in order to maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of our work in combating soil degradation and poverty .
With this in mind , the main EU objective for the Madrid conference is the adoption of the ten-year strategic plan to improve the application of the Convention , which was drawn up by a working group in accordance with the conclusions of the last conference of the parties , which was held in 2005 .
This plan , which is strongly supported by the European Union , represents the parties ' joint , renewed vision of the strategic direction to take over the next ten years .
If , as we hope , this joint vision is adopted , we will need to create an effective framework for applying it in order to maximise the effectiveness of the work of the Secretariat of the Convention and its other institutions .
Finally , this package of reforms will be accompanied by a realistic budget that is acceptable to all parties , establishing provision for expenditure that is in line with the planned activities , fulfilling very strict standards of transparency and clarity .
In July , as the President-in-Office of the Council said , the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted the overall approach that I have been talking about .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , I am proud that in Parliament we have been able to draw up a resolution to be submitted to the next convention , which is already being held in Madrid , organised by the UN .
I am proud , too , that - as I have just been informed - the Spanish Parliament has given us its permission , which is absolutely exceptional , and I thank Mr Marín , President of the Spanish Congress for this ; we have a voice and we are also going to present it to the plenary sitting of the Spanish Parliament .
I am , however , quite sceptical about the subject of desertification .
The European Commission 's own documents show that the aid that has been given in recent years and the policy that has been undertaken has not produced the required results .
Why ?
Because the desertification policy would require integrated systems and for all the points of view to be brought together and , unfortunately , the authorities operate separately : agriculture does not operate with the environment , water policy operates separately and , in actual fact , the desertification problems , for example the large area of land that is being abandoned , with no activity , in the case of the Mediterranean , are extraordinary .
The same European agricultural policy is causing land to be abandoned in the south , and across Europe , and the CAP is going to have a significant impact on desertification .
Not to mention climate change , an area , for example , in which nothing is being done about the problem of water shortage and the melting of the glaciers , which is already occurring and is going to have an absolute effect on the situation of the soil .
I would therefore like to bring to the attention of the countries that rather than making observations , they should make specific policies and implement programmes , because it really is a question of integrated projects in which states have to tackle integrated policies and active policies .
I think that everything is known about desertification , but very little action is being taken .
This is the message that we are going to take , Europe helping with this common policy .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , according to the United Nations Environment Programme , desertification threatens a quarter of the earth 's land surface , as well as 250 million people and the livelihoods of more than a billion inhabitants in 100 countries because of decreased agricultural and livestock productivity .
Poverty , political instability , deforestation , excessive grazing and bad practices are factors that reduce the productivity of land .
I therefore hope that in Madrid , after more than 13 years since the UN Convention to Combat Desertification came into being , the international community will debate a reform of the Convention itself , in order to include measures that make the fight against this phenomenon more effective , especially the draft ten-year strategic plan that is being debated .
Soil erosion , uncontrolled urban development , loss of fertile land , fires , deforestation and the over-exploitation of water resources are some of the causes that explain the impoverishment of a great deal of arid , semi-arid or dry soil , and these causes are carrying us inexorably towards growing desertification of the planet , which we need to try to stop by every possible means .
We also need to remember , as the Members who have already spoken have said , that desertification contributes to climate change , as it causes the degradation of the soil and the loss of vegetation , which is associated with an increase in emissions , therefore it would be very helpful to support reforestation policies in order to re-establish and change conditions in arid areas .
With regard to the European Union itself , I think that it is essential that a European drought observatory be established urgently , something that we have considered several times in this House , as a centre for knowledge , mitigation and monitoring of its terrible effects , especially in southern Europe .
I think that there is an urgent need for greater involvement from the Community institutions on the subject of desertification , so that the European Union can lead the way in this area in the same way as it is doing in the fight against climate change .
I would like to close by saying that combating this problem is a major challenge , not only from the environmental viewpoint but also from the viewpoint of people and human rights : many people are fleeing their lands because of hunger and poverty , largely caused by desertification .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my thanks go to Mr Ouzký and the others for an excellent motion for a resolution .
According to the United Nations , desertification now affects 100 to 200 million people directly .
It is a potential threat for more than a billion , and possibly even as many as two billion , people .
It is not just a matter of the Sahara spreading and such similar phenomena .
Desertification , the disappearance of fertile layers of soil and vegetation , is taking place all around the world , from the coasts of Spain to the plains of China .
Almost a third of the land area of the globe is at risk of desertification .
As much as 40 % of arable land is now in very poor condition .
The situation is worst in Central Asia , where three-quarters of the soil is infertile .
Climate change is worsening desertification , although until now it has been mostly local activity which has affected it , such as logging and inappropriate farming , irrigation and cattle breeding methods .
Whilst climate change is making desertification worse , desertification is aggravating climate change , because less carbon binding with the soil eventually results in the carbon being released into the atmosphere .
Unless we act wisely , consistently and promptly , we may create a vicious circle .
Combating desertification entails the prevention of hunger and , through that , the prevention of conflict .
Last June the UN warned that over the next 10 years desertification could drive 50 million people from their homes , mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and Central Asia .
This would also mean more people trying to enter Europe illegally .
The Darfur crisis has been described as the first climate change conflict .
The water shortage is just one aspect of the crisis .
It is more generally recognised that the prolonged water shortage and the decline in the land 's productivity have helped fuel conflict .
As stated in the resolution , there needs to be investment in sustainable land use .
Measures to prevent desertification will be a lot cheaper than its consequences .
A cautionary example on a small scale is the Easter Islands .
There was a flourishing culture there at one time , but when the forests were cut down the soil became poor , the islands turned into dry grasslands , and a thriving culture collapsed in a short space of time .
If we act wisely , consistently and determinedly , we can stop all humanity suffering the same fate .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this eighth conference on desertification is an extremely important opportunity , in a proper forum such as the UN , but it also requires specific responses to a dramatic situation .
Climate change is accelerating processes already under way affecting very fragile areas such as Africa , but not sparing our own continent .
Hunger and disease , migrations of biblical proportions and fires are our future , but also our present .
We therefore need to make strong , clear choices .
The first is , naturally , to implement Kyoto and to sign , at long last , the post-Kyoto agreement , a multilateral agreement providing the frame of reference for a different future .
Further choices are also needed so that we can adapt in order to protect lives .
There is a real tragedy : its name is water .
The right to access to water is already being denied and is likely to be denied more and more for millions of people .
For this reason , we should oppose processes to privatise this resource , which is vital for life .
Access to water should be guaranteed and it should become a genuine common asset belonging to humanity , including through a solemn declaration by the UN that would subsequently make it possible to put in place public policies to guarantee such a right .
It is also necessary for the fight against desertification to guide financial policies on climate .
For example , all good practices that allow CO2 capture through agriculture and forestry ought to be promoted and encouraged .
This ought also to lead to a review of choices such as those in the common agricultural policy , which have encouraged a decoupling of productive activities carrying with it a risk of desertification and fires .
Choices such as intensive production of biomass for energy ought also to be reconsidered .
In Europe too , it is also necessary to have a specific , strong policy relating to soil , as for water and air .
For this reason we must not erect obstacles , as is being done in this Parliament by a section of the European People 's Party , but instead the framework directive on soil protection put forward by the Commission should be welcomed .
It provides that soil should form an integral part of climate policy .
Desertification is also caused by a dearth of policy .
We must combat it with good policy .
Mr President , there are areas within the European Union that fall victim to long periods of drought and its devastating impact every year or every few years ; it is good therefore that this is being taken into account in policymaking .
In fact , there are two causes of desertification : one natural and one man-made .
Drought is a natural cause that can lead to poor soil condition , particularly in combination with man-made causes such as poor management of agricultural land , forests and water .
The risk of desertification then increases hand over fist , particularly in Europe 's Mediterranean regions .
Now that many climatologists are predicting an increase in temperature , with an increased risk of extreme drought , it is good to take preventive measures to limit the impact of drought , including desertification .
In my view , policy must be targeted at both the natural and the man-made causes of desertification .
As regards the natural causes , it is important to use the available water as effectively as possible .
Water must be conserved where possible , and soil must be prevented from drying out .
One way of achieving the latter is to ensure good forest management .
Good water management is also important .
Existing legislation on water can also be employed here .
My home country , the Netherlands , has a national coordination centre , which comes into operation as soon as drought threatens , and implements measures at regional level .
Frameworks can be laid down at European or UN level , but implementation must take place primarily at national and regional level .
Voluntary partnerships between problem areas with a view to learning to deal with the problems strike me as another effective possibility .
These can take the form of a knowledge platform with both political and scientific input .
Such initiatives also exist in connection with the implementation of the Directive on the assessment and management of flood risks , and appear to be having a positive impact .
( RO ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , global warming is a threat whose long-term effects are devastating .
This summer we witnessed the effects of the heatwave in Greece and other European countries , floods in Great Britain and extreme droughts in Romania .
Global warming effects became more and more visible for Romania in Dobrogea , Southern field or Western sands .
Following global warming , Romania will be , together with Spain , Greece and Italy , among the countries facing climate change the most by 2015 .
Almost a quarter of Romanian territory will become arid in the next 20 years and many plant species will disappear .
The effects of desertification are already visible .
The situation in Romania is not unique in the European Union and that is why we have to act together based on the principle of solidarity which the European project is founded on .
Assessments 10 years áfter the entry into effect of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification , indicate increasing desertification trends while the reaction of states is absent .
If no measures to eliminate the negative factors are taken , desertification will be present forever or the costs for environmental remediation will be incomensurate .
Dear colleagues , preventing desertification is easier than removing it .
Efficient crop management , increased attention to irrigation systems and drawing up strategies for ensuring workplaces in non-agricultural fields for the inhabitants of dry areas could represent solutions for preventing desertification .
In order to ensure the efficiency of the efforts in combating desertification we need integrated development systems at national , regional and international level .
Meanwhile , Convention implementation has to be closely linked to the efforts of limiting climate change .
Having regard to the abovementioned points , I would like to ask a question to the Commission : at the Conference in Madrid , will the Commission announce a change or a toning of the strategy and undertake new obligations on behalf of the EU as regards the Convention , having regard the accession of the most recent countries ?
( PT ) The Green Paper on climate change draws attention to the natural phenomena aggravated by climate change .
Climate change is expected to lead to a reduction in rainfall , higher temperatures and a higher incidence of heat waves and periods of drought , leading to increased desertification .
Unlike other natural disasters , the impact of drought does not affect infrastructures but production and the environment , as well as the lives of local people .
One of the serious consequences of drought is the difficulty of supplying the population with drinking water .
Studies show that droughts and floods kill more people than any other natural disaster .
Moreover , 8 million people die each year from diseases linked to the consumption of unsafe water , for example because of dysentery , cholera and typhoid fever .
Shortage of drinking water causes 80 % of illnesses and deaths in developing countries .
More than 4 500 children die each day of diseases caused by lack of water .
It was not by chance that the Informal Meeting of Environment Ministers , held in Lisbon a few days ago , was devoted to the problems of water shortage and drought , which is , moreover , one of the major concerns and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency 's Programme for the environment , as the Secretary of State already mentioned .
It is hoped that the Conference of the Parties will take the appropriate decisions for combating drought and desertification and that the European Institutions will also make their contribution .
( EL ) Mr President , it is one of life 's little ironies that this discussion should take place after the summer 's tragic events in southern Europe .
These disasters will unfortunately play a major part in changing the landscape and creating future environmental problems .
Desertification is not a modern problem ; it has been with us for decades .
In the past , the gradual deterioration of fertile soil has been a complex process .
It has multiple causes and proceeds at varying rates according to climatic differences .
For example , desertification may intensify an existing general climatic tendency towards greater dryness , or it may initially arise from a change in the local climate .
It is important to stress that the presence of a nearby desert has no bearing on desertification .
Unfortunately , an area undergoing desertification only comes to the public 's attention once the process is well under way .
There is often very little information available to indicate the previous state of the ecosystem or the degree of degradation .
We therefore need to be particularly careful about what is to be done with the burnt land in southern Europe : in the near future there is a danger of climate change , which could well cause desertification in the stricken regions .
Scientists also happen to be investigating whether desertification is a permanent factor in the process of global change , and how and when desertification can be stopped or reversed .
This will be one of the topics for discussion at the United Nations International Conference .
More efficient use of existing water resources and control of salinisation are effective tools for areas of dry soil .
There are also ways of using surface water resources such as rainwater .
In addition to science , politics can be considered as a useful tool for combating desertification .
If we are to halt and reverse the degradation of dry and semi-barren soil , we must understand how and why the rate of climate change , population growth and food production affect these environments .
The most effective intervention arises only from the prudent use of the best information .
As a conclusion to this discussion , a resolution on the European Union 's aims has been submitted to the United Nations Conference .
Let me emphasise two points which I consider to be very important .
First , it is finally time for the EU to fork out , if it wishes to call itself the ' European Union ' ; it must assign legally binding funding to actions to combat desertification .
Second , the EU should not rob Peter to pay Paul : it cannot present itself as protector of the environment having failed to promote mandatory general regulations prohibiting the import into the EU of illegal timber that has not been sustainably felled .
Indeed , desertification concerns not only the European Union , but the whole planet .
If , then , the EU wishes to make its presence felt , it must take appropriate steps , and not go to Madrid merely as an observer .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I seem to have detected in this debate a certain sadness , a certain consternation and perhaps a little scepticism on the part of some Members as to what we can do from now on to combat drought and desertification , having regard to what we have done to date in this field .
However , I think that the conditioning factors and the context have changed significantly since 1994 , particularly in more recent times .
I think that the growing awareness among governments , politicians in general , civil society and public opinion of issues concerning climate change , the environmental challenges facing us and , in particular , combating desertification , climate change and water shortages , will help us to press ahead , with confidence , optimism , and a renewed impetus in combating the serious environmental problems that we shall increasingly have to face .
We also have reasons for some confidence and optimism when we see the Council of the European Union taking on important commitments , I would even say extremely important commitments , and taking the lead internationally in announcing measures for combating climate change and proposing that they become standards , goals to be achieved by the entire international community .
Portugal , in its Presidency of the European Union , will naturally have an important role to play here too , since we shall be leading the European Union at the Bali Conference which , as you know , will be preparing the decisions that we shall need to take in that area post-Kyoto 2012 .
We think that the Madrid Conference of the Parties to the Convention to Combat Desertification could in fact provide an opportunity for renewing and updating the commitments made in 1994 .
We hope so .
We have three or four priorities that we think it would be useful to achieve .
First , it is our opinion that the Parties to the Convention should improve their internal coordination as regards combating desertification , by taking a more integrated approach to this issue as a whole .
As the honourable Member mentioned , ministers for the various sectors often adopt domestic measures without previously agreeing on the objectives to be attained , so that decision-making is rather ad hoc and random .
At national level , therefore , coordination between the various departments holding responsibilities in this area needs in fact to be more effective and more efficient .
It was mentioned in this House , and I also said it myself in my first speech , that it is very important for civil society to feel more involved in implementing the measures needed to combat desertification .
Many of the problems are specific and localised , having a profound effect on the local population , and it is important in this combat that there should be a sense of ' ownership ' or taking on board of the policies necessary to combat desertification .
We must also enhance the institutional mechanisms for implementing the Convention .
We also think it is important , at regional and international level , to step up such cooperation as well as cooperation to combat desertification .
The Parties to the Convention frequently tend to view their own problems from an exclusively national point of view .
This is one area where it seems to us , by the very nature of the problems involved , that regional and international cooperation are particularly appropriate .
To conclude , the question of the budget was mentioned here - budgetary appropriations .
It is an important point ; naturally we must also allocate sufficient financial resources to enable these mechanisms to meet needs .
The establishment of a European observatory on drought was mentioned .
That was in fact one of the points discussed and debated at the informal meeting of Environment Ministers in Portugal and one could conclude from that debate that they regard the establishment of a European observatory on drought as an important measure both to draw attention to drought-related problems as well as to build the model required for the measures which must be , or could be , implemented in order to combat drought .
This is therefore , as I said , a measure that the Environment Ministers view with interest and enthusiasm .
Let us hope , then , that the Madrid Conference will produce results that come up to our expectations .
Ladies and gentlemen , it has been a very interesting debate , in which I would like to point out that five women and three men spoke .
I think that this is very important and that it shows that our female Members are particularly sensitive regarding such a fundamental issue .
To conclude the debate , I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 108 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. pending Question Time and resumed at 5.30 p.m. )
Council Question Time
The next item is Question Time ( B6-0138 / 2007 ) .
The following questions have been submitted to the Council :
Subject : Global approach to immigration
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The EU institutions implement the series of measures envisaged in the Council conclusions of 18 June 2007 within the limits of their competence as conferred upon them by the Treaty , in cooperation with the Member States and , whenever appropriate , with the third countries concerned .
The responsibility for the control and surveillance of external borders falls to Member States .
However , it is of interest to all Member States belonging to the Schengen agreement , not merely those which have external borders , to ensure that external border controls are effective ; certain measures have therefore been taken to promote solidarity and cooperation between Member States in this area .
The establishing of a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union , an agency generally known as Frontex , by Regulation ( EC ) No 2007 / 2004 , was an important step in promoting that solidarity .
Joint operations and pilot projects are launched with the agreement of the Member States concerned .
The Rapid Border Intervention Teams are set up in response to a request lodged by one or more Member States .
Frontex coordinates those activities .
There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the decision-making competence of the Commission or of Frontex in this context .
( ES ) President-in-Office , thank you very much for the information you have given me .
I am aware of the constitutional limitations on the development of these cooperation measures as well as the resistance of many Member States to taking on greater commitments , but we always run the risk that the European Union 's words will not be confirmed by the facts , and specifically in the functioning of the Frontex mechanism .
I hope that the Presidency will encourage the consolidation of a system that will give greater permanency to this type of operation .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I understand your concern .
In any case we must , I think , here too , take a positive view of the progress made .
If we bear in mind where we have come from and where we were , the establishing of the Frontex Agency is , in my view , already progress and a step forward in cooperation within the European Union on matters concerning the management of external borders .
We may , as you say , develop the capabilities and competences of Frontex , if the Member States so wish .
However , a word applies here too I think , and it is not an intergovernmental word , but a fundamental word , a word , I would say , on which our Union is founded - and that word is solidarity .
We must rely , here too , on that solidarity , solidarity with the Member States who might at one time or another have need of it .
That word - there is no substitute for it - is a word denoting not an intergovernmental situation , but rather union .
( DE ) President-in-Office , I should like to be more specific .
The idea of Frontex is excellent , but the implementation is poor .
One reason for this is that the Member States are not providing the staff or equipment they have promised .
Mr Frattini has found that only 10 % has been provided .
I should like you to tell me - and Parliament - how many of the staff and which technical equipment promised by which Member States has actually been supplied to date and what is still outstanding , and what action you envisage to ensure that all Member States finally provide what they have promised , to enable Frontex to function all year round .
I also understand the honourable Member 's question .
We must bear in mind the commitments we have made within the Frontex area , whether in terms of equipment , funding or personnel , and we must stand by our commitments , and I would point out that the Presidency has not omitted to call attention to those aspects .
If we are failing to deliver on the commitments , then we must put that right as a matter of urgency .
That is the only way to enable the Frontex Agency to effectively exercise the role and competences allocated to it .
( DE ) I should be interested to hear whether the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises has been considered - after all , these make a substantial contribution to employment in Europe .
I should also like to know the extent to which - as has been seen in the United States - female employment , in particular , has added measures to the Lisbon agenda .
Has the Council taken any relevant precautions to integrate workers accordingly ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) As regards the differences in treatment between men and women in respect of gainful employment , basic legislation has already been approved , including certain directives which provide for equal treatment as regards pay , job access , professional training , promotion and working conditions .
Furthermore , the Commission and Eurostat are responsible for monitoring the situation in this sector in the various parts of the European Union .
It is clear that , in order to formulate policies , there is a basic need for high quality data covering the whole of the European Union .
Here I am very pleased to recall the agreement reached recently between the Council and the Parliament on the setting up of the European Institute for Gender Equality , which will operate precisely in that area .
On the subject of updating labour legislation , the Council can take action only on the basis of a legislative proposal from the Commission .
Nevertheless , the Council is also applying more open methods for coordination under the European employment strategy .
In this policy area our attention is currently focused on the recent Commission communication on flexicurity , which specifically mentions gender equality as one of the possible joint principles to be agreed at the European Union level .
We also welcome the fact that the Spring 2007 European Council agreed to set up a family alliance to serve as a platform for exchanging opinions and knowledge on good practices and policies for families .
As regards the question of introducing safeguard clauses for the protection of maternity and the reconciliation of working and family life in the private sector , I am pleased to mention the important directives already approved in the field of maternity leave and the protection of maternity and new-born infants at the workplace .
( EL ) Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for reiterating the measures which , as we know , have been taken in the interests of equality .
I am asking about the positive discrimination in the legislation of some Member States .
For example , lower pension thresholds are provided for mothers ; will this be condemned today by the European Commission , which is taking those Member States to the European Court ?
Is the Council going to decide in favour of such positive discrimination ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) A careful reading of the programmes of the German , Slovenian and Portuguese Presidencies will show that social issues , specifically issues of gender equality and the protection of the family , are very high on our list of concerns .
In cooperation with the Commission and each within our own sphere of responsibility we shall , of course , be presenting measures that may be more favourable and may in fact reflect our concerns on social matters .
Those concerns are essential in a modern society such as the EU , taking account of the respective competences of the EU and the Member States .
Let me assure the honourable Member that social issues , in particular those concerning the protection of the family , are priorities for all three Presidencies and , in this specific case , for the Portuguese Presidency .
I hope that by December we shall not have disappointed her in this area .
( LT ) As far back as 1975 the European Union adopted legal acts prohibiting discrimination in the provision of salaries and requiring that men and women were paid equal salaries for equal jobs .
Already 30 years have passed , yet these legal acts have not yet been implemented .
I would like to ask the Council to present its opinion .
Can Member States themselves choose which acts they will implement and which they will not ?
What is the situation in Portugal ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I would remind the House that the Council , in its conclusions of 23 and 24 July 2007 , reiterated its full support for President Abbas and the Government led by Prime Minister Fayyad .
The Council reaffirmed its position on events in Gaza : the only way to achieve Palestine 's national objectives by peaceful , legal and democratic means is through reconciliation and national unity based on the peace programme devised by President Abbas .
The Council also stated that the EU is opposed to any division whatsoever of the Palestinian territories and confirmed that the EU is ready to collaborate with all Palestinian parties whose policy and actions reflect the principles of the Quartet .
The EU resumed relations with the institutions of the Palestinian Authority .
We began providing direct financial and technical aid to the Palestinian Government .
In its conclusions of 23 and 24 July 2007 , the Council reaffirmed its pledge to help establish the institutions and economy of the future Palestinian State and stressed the need to develop the economy fully in the Palestinian Occupied Territories , including by promoting cooperation with Palestine 's private sector .
The Council confirmed its support for the Palestinian civil police by remobilising the EUPOL COPPS mission .
The Commission also called upon Israel to provide the conditions required for such a mission .
The policy of the European Union has been , ever since the Palestinian elections , to refuse to talk to elected representatives associated with Hamas .
Every time Hamas has made a small step that might be interpreted as being in our direction , we have slammed the door in its face .
From talks I have had with some of the President-in-Office 's colleagues in Lisbon , I know that there are members of his Government who believe that this policy has been a disastrous failure .
But , in this instance , his job is to talk on behalf of the Council and defend the indefensible .
Can he tell the House in what ways the Council believes that its policy has proven a success ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I would point out that the Middle East peace Quartet met recently in Lisbon .
We are confident and believe that we shall be able to devise measures within the scope of the Quartet , and also within the scope of the European Union , that can help make progress with the Middle East peace process .
The situation there has remained unchanged for many years and we know it is a complex and difficult situation that cannot be resolved overnight .
However , we think that the political conditions might now be in place to enable us to make positive progress .
The Portuguese Presidency wants to work towards that , as does the Council of the European Union .
We need to seize the moment and grasp the opportunity .
We must take advantage of the political context and make the most of the sense of urgency to solve this problem , which I think we feel is there at the moment in relation to the Middle East peace process .
We must be realistic yet confident and we must not think of giving up .
Let me rephrase Mr Davies ' very good question .
Does the Council believe we can make progress in the Middle East without bringing Hamas to the table ?
Unless Hamas is involved in discussions , the Quartet can meet all they want but there will be no solution .
Does the Council accept that some day it is going to have to sit face-to-face with Hamas to solve this situation ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) As you know , the Council agreed upon principles and policy lines for the Middle East peace process that it intends to uphold ; it believes in those principles and in those policy lines that shape its political action , and it is intending to stick to them .
As the author is not present , Question No 4 lapses .
Subject : Aid for trade
The Finnish and German Presidencies are to be congratulated on the priority they assigned to aid for trade .
What steps will the Portuguese Presidency take to ensure that spending on trade-related assistance from the Commission , and in particular Member States , continues on the correct trajectory toward the target of € 1 billion annually by 2010 ?
Indeed does the Presidency have , or will it seek , clarification of the individual countries ' financial commitment toward the € 1 billion target ?
How will the Portuguese Presidency ensure that the Member States and the Commission deliver adequate assistance in those aspects of aid for trade identified by the WTO aid for trade taskforce in 2006 , such as trade-related adjustment and trade-related infrastructure , which fall outside of the definition of trade-related assistance and therefore outside of the € 2 billion target ?
One of the Presidency 's objectives is actually to reach an agreement on EU aid for trade strategy at October 's General Affairs and External Relations Council , including an outline of the specific steps envisaged for attaining the EUR 2 billion agreed for trade-related assistance by 2010 , notably the EUR 1 billion from the Member States to meet the needs identified by the developing countries .
The Presidency is confident that that will be achieved .
The strategy also aims to make a contribution to the broader agenda of aid for trade and to the definition of the measures to be implemented .
Therefore , on 5 July 2007 , the Portuguese Presidency presented a draft EU aid for trade strategy which is under discussion in the relevant Council formations .
The draft strategy should be seen in the context of following up the recommendations put forward in 2006 by the WTO Aid for Trade Task Force .
I am very encouraged by the President-in-Office 's response and wish him well for the October meeting .
I hope he gets a successful package .
If he does , will he consider publishing towards the end of this year how much each of the individual Member States has contributed in the form of aid for trade ?
We know the Commission EUR 1 billion is very transparent , and it is very obvious how it is being spent .
It is not so clear where the EUR 1 billion from the Member States is supposed to come from , whether this is actually happening and who it is coming from .
Would the Council consider publishing that in November or December ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) I thank the honourable Member for his words of encouragement and confidence .
The Presidency and the Council will take the appropriate action on this matter in line with the applicable practices , conditions and legislative provisions .
Subject : Northern dimension policy
The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has stated that it will seek to promote EU cooperation with the Mediterranean countries .
As the EU also has a northern dimension , how will the Council Presidency simultaneously promote the EU 's northern dimension policy and its implementation ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) We have been implementing the northern dimension policy since the beginning of this year on the basis of two documents adopted at the Northern Dimension Summit held in Helsinki in November 2006 .
The policy framework document and the political statement adopted in Helsinki represent a turning point for the northern dimension , insofar as they turn the policy into a joint policy shared by all the northern dimension partners , that is , the EU , Russia , Norway and Iceland .
Joint acceptance of the new policy is a key objective and includes Russia 's full participation in all northern dimension structures and activities .
The other main participants and actors in the northern dimension , in particular the four Northern Regional Councils and the international financial institutions , will also be involved in the process .
The northern dimension now represents a permanent platform for debating northern issues and concerns .
The Portuguese Presidency will certainly take work forward in this area .
A Steering Group meeting is planned for late September , early October in Reykjavík .
The Steering Group aims to provide continuity between the ministerial meetings and the Senior Officials ' meetings .
A meeting of Senior Officials is scheduled during the Portuguese Presidency , to be held on 21 November in Russia .
As a Mediterranean country , Portugal would like to see a more intense and broader political debate with our partners from the southern shores of the Mediterranean within the context of Euromed .
The EU and Euromed countries share common interests and are facing similar challenges .
It is in our own interest to broaden EU cooperation with those countries , especially with regard to tackling migration flows and social development .
At the same time , we shall continue to work on implementing the new northern dimension policy .
As in the case of Euromed , a great deal could be achieved through practical cooperation based on good neighbourliness , a partnership of equality , joint responsibility and transparency .
( FI ) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Russia 's role is crucial in the development of the Northern Dimension .
The European Union 's relations with Russia are important in that respect .
Does the Presidency have any intentions this autumn of promoting talks with Russia on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) As you know , during its term of office the Portuguese Presidency is to organise a summit with Russia to be held in Mafra , a town not far from our capital , Lisbon .
We are hoping to consider during that summit all the issues pertaining to cooperation and EU-Russia relations , within the economic , scientific , and cultural fields as well as fields directly concerning the freedom of movement of persons in the European area .
We regard it as important and strategic to establish a mutually advantageous and beneficial relationship with Russia based on shared principles and values .
Subject : Frontex
What has been the Council 's experience over the last few months with Frontex , and what is its opinion of the idea of developing it into a real European border service , based on the German border police ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union , known as Frontex , set up by Regulation ( EC ) No 2007 / 2004 , which I mentioned earlier , is intended to improve integrated management at the EU 's external borders .
The role and functions of the Frontex Agency are set out in the Regulation , which takes account of the fact that the Member States retain responsibility for the control and surveillance of external borders .
The powers of the Frontex Agency were strengthened recently by the approval on 12 June 2007 of the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams .
The European Council , in its conclusions of June 2007 , welcomed the agreement reached on Rapid Border Intervention Teams and the launching of the European patrol network and the creation of a centralised toolbox of technical equipment to be made available by and to Member States .
At the moment there are no other proposals to amend the Frontex Regulation .
The Hague programme strengthening freedom , security and justice , invites the Commission to present to the Council an evaluation of the agency by the end of 2007 .
That evaluation should analyse the functions of the agency and indicate whether it should take on other responsibilities relating to aspects of border management .
( DE ) I was concerned less with the regulation and more with the vision .
In 1998 I presented a report in this House on enlargement and internal security in which I proposed a European border service .
The Tampere Summit addressed this idea , along with that of a European Police College .
Frontex was created as an initial step in that direction .
Does the Council Presidency share the vision of further developing Frontex and the battle groups into a real European border service for the common protection of our external borders ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The Presidency agrees that improving cross-border cooperation for the purposes of law enforcement is not only an important and pressing question , but also a challenge .
The Council draft decision on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation , particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime - the well known ' Prüm ' Decision - on which the Council reached political agreement in June 2007 , represents considerable progress on the implementation of the principle of availability and the strengthening of cross-border police cooperation , in particular by means of joint operations and the provision of assistance for mass events , disasters and serious accidents .
The Presidency is of the opinion that the ' Prüm ' Decision should be implemented as soon as possible , in order to enable tangible results to be achieved .
The Presidency is therefore intending to concentrate its efforts on seeing that progress is made in the next few months on the Council draft decision implementing the ' Prüm ' Decision .
The Presidency agrees with the honourable Member that not all the points in the two Commission proposals - one on improving police cooperation and the other on the principle of availability - are included in the ' Prüm ' Decision .
However , a considerable part of the Commission proposal on police cooperation is covered by the ' Prüm ' Decision and the Presidency has no reason to think that reopening the debate on the other parts would lead to a different result from the one achieved in April 2006 .
Whereas the Commission proposal on the principle of availability lays down general principles and covers six types of data , the ' Prüm ' Decision in fact deals only with DNA data , fingerprints and vehicle registration data .
The Presidency believes that phased implementation of the principle of availability is the most realistic and practical and is also among the approaches most likely to yield practical results in the short term for day-to-day police cooperation and improving security for EU citizens .
The Presidency believes that those practical results would send a strong signal regarding the importance and urgency attached to cross-border cooperation , thus demonstrating that practical cooperation is possible and is being implemented , even if only partially .
That does not mean that we do not need to continue efforts to achieve even closer cooperation on law enforcement , in particular by means of the elements contained in the Commission proposals .
It is hoped , however , that this can be done on the basis of the results obtained to date as well as those resulting from implementing the ' Prüm ' Decision .
Mr President , can the Council therefore confirm that discussions in the Council on both the availability principle and the police cooperation measure have been suspended ?
You have recognised that the Prüm Treaty is less ambitious than either of those , so have you suspended them ?
Why can the Council keep legislating for things that infringe on people 's personal privacy but they cannot get to the root of cooperation between police ?
One of the impediments to that is the lack of an overall data protection framework , of course .
We were promised by the German Presidency that such an instrument would be adopted this year .
Is the Portuguese Presidency actively progressing that , and what are the main blockages ?
The Council and the Member States need to get on with practical cooperation of policing within a firm data protection framework .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The Portuguese Presidency is operating in this area in an ambitious but also realistic manner .
When considering the measures taken or that we are proposing to take , we always look at the starting point and our intended destination and , in fact , on this matter of police cooperation , I think that we have made remarkable and considerable progress in relation to our starting point .
Perhaps not all the progress that many would like to see , but something has been done and is being done if the Member States so desire .
The Portuguese Presidency will therefore support , develop and implement the measures that were agreed and that in our view represent positive progress in police cooperation in relation to the previous situation .
Subject : Ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate of Constantinople
Numerous events are indicative of the Turkish authorities ' attempts to call into question the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate of Constantinople .
The Foreign Minister , for example , has expressly ruled out recognition by the Turkish Government of the ecumenical nature of the Patriarchate of Constantinople .
Furthermore , Turkish officials have been prohibited from attending a reception given by the Patriarchate of Constantinople because the invitation refers to the Patriarch as ecumenical .
Moreover , the new national security policy of Turkey states that ' any attempt to overstep the current status of the Patriarchate must be deterred ' and , finally , on 26 June 2007 , the Turkish Supreme Court ruled that the Patriarchate of Constantinople is not ecumenical and that the Patriarch is head of the Greek Orthodox community of Istanbul .
Will the Council say whether the position of the Turkish authorities in regard to the Patriarchate of Constantinople is consistent with the Copenhagen political criteria and Turkey 's obligations under the pre-accession process ?
What immediate representations will it make to the Turkish authorities ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The Council has repeatedly stressed the importance it attaches to the issue of religious freedom in Turkey .
Religious minorities and communities are still encountering difficulties linked to legal personality , property rights , schools , internal management and training , residence permits and work permits concerning Turkish and non-Turkish clergy in addition to the possibility of foreign clergy being elected leaders of their religious communities .
The specific problems facing the Orthodox Patriarchate , in particular the use of the ecclesiastical title of Ecumenical Patriarch , must also be examined in that context .
That situation should not affect the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights .
Religious freedom is a fundamental area in which tangible progress needs to be made as a matter of urgency ; it also requires specific action for the adoption and implementation of appropriate legislation in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights .
More specifically , one of the short-term priorities in relations between the European Union and Turkey is the adoption of legislation that is in accordance with the relevant European standards and provides a response to all the difficulties encountered by minorities and non-Muslim religious communities .
Similarly , social tolerance needs to be developed .
In that context , I can reassure the honourable Member that the issue of religious freedom will continue to be closely monitored , as part of the accession negotiations in the context of Chapter 23 , Judiciary and Fundamental Rights , and of the ongoing process of reforms in Turkey , and will be broached at all levels whenever relevant .
That was the case at the last Ministerial Troika meeting between the European Union and Turkey held in Ankara on 4 June .
( EL ) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , in the two and a half minutes during which you have spoken , you have confirmed the problem that I put to you in my question , but you have not adopted a clear position .
On 22 August Commissioner Rehn , speaking on behalf of the Commission , said that the Patriarch and the Patriarchate had to be free to use the ecclesiastical title ' Ecumenical ' and added that Turkey had to ensure that non-Muslim communities could acquire legal status .
Does the Council share this unequivocal position adopted by the Commission ?
If so , why do you not say so clearly ?
If not , what are the reasons ?
Who has made you so reticent ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr Papadimoulis , I think that , as regards questions of human rights in our relations with Turkey , the Presidency and the Council have been clear , demanding and firm both now and in the past , as they will also be in the future .
I think , therefore , it is perhaps inappropriate to express doubts , reservations or scepticism on this matter .
We shall maintain our stance in our talks with Turkey , notably in the process of negotiations on Turkey 's accession to the EU .
( DE ) We have discussed this many times before during Question Time , and I should like to ask when Turkey 's law on religion will actually be adopted .
We were assured of this over a year ago , and nothing has happened .
This is a very specific point relevant not only to the country 's accession negotiations but also to its compliance with the political Copenhagen criteria .
The State does not have the right to interfere in the internal affairs of a church and arbitrarily deprive it of any legal status .
As the honourable Member knows , there is a kind of annual review of the process of Turkey 's accession to the EU .
That review , or stock-taking of the process , takes place in the second half of each year and entails an analysis of and debate on all these issues on the basis of Commission reports .
That will take place again this year during the Portuguese Presidency and will provide a suitable opportunity , the right opportunity , moreover , for those issues to be debated - as they will be - by the Council .
As the author is not present , Question No 10 lapses .
Subject : Outcome of the EU-Brazil summit
Could the Council give its assessment of the EU-Brazil summit held on 4 July 2007 , in particular the economic and trade relations dimension ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) As you know , the EU-Brazil summit was held in Lisbon on 4 July with a view to launching a bilateral strategic partnership to enhance cooperation between the two parties in a wide range of areas of common interest .
A joint declaration was approved covering various areas in which our bilateral relations should be strengthened and it was agreed that this partnership with Brazil should be operational and forward-looking .
The EU and Brazil worked together to draw up an action plan containing practical , joint , coordinated proposals on issues that will help to formulate a common agenda .
The interesting debate covered bilateral relations between the European Union and Brazil , regional issues , in particular developments in Europe and Latin America , but also world issues such as the Doha Development Agenda , effective multilateralism , climate change , combating poverty and social exclusion plus energy-related matters .
As regards trade relations , although the Lisbon summit was not the appropriate forum for technical negotiations , there was an interesting exchange of views .
The Commissioner for Trade , Peter Mandelson , repeated that obtaining positive results in the Doha Development Round was , and would continue to be a priority for the EU .
Despite the disappointing results of the recent G4 Group meeting in Potsdam , talks continued in Geneva and no one wanted to miss the opportunity to reach an ambitious , balanced and comprehensive agreement .
Brazil thought that the two negotiating positions were not so wide apart .
Continuing debate and closer coordination would make it possible to reach an agreement .
Both parties concurred that reaching an agreement in Doha would help to conclude an agreement between the EU and Mercosul .
On the subjects of climate change and energy , both parties referred to the International Conference on Biofuels held on 5 and 6 July in Brussels , as a step in the right direction to allay criticisms that the use of biofuels was allegedly harmful .
In this context the President of the Commission , José Manuel Barroso , mentioned three essential areas : the setting of joint technical standards for a sustainable international market in biofuels , biofuels as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving security of food supply .
President Lula in turn linked the debate on climate change to reducing pollution , stating that the combined energy approach followed in Brazil over the past 20 years had proved to be more environmentally friendly and environmentally sound than the EU 's high-technology engines .
Furthermore , he refuted the allegations of threats to the Amazon forest and to security of food supply .
Thank you very much for the comprehensive outline of the range of interests that were discussed .
Clearly , agriculture was amongst them , but could I ask whether the controversial issue of beef exports from Brazil to the European Union was raised , as well as the concerns about standards in relation to those , and if there is common ground on the WTO - the Doha Round - between the two parties ?
Was the issue of double standards - the higher standards within the European Union , compared with those countries outside and specifically , in this case , Brazil - raised as part of the talks ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The summit was , as mentioned here , an initiative of the Portuguese Presidency ; it was the first summit meeting held with Brazil and will , we hope , lead to the development of strategic relations with that country .
That was a first initiative .
It was intended to identify those areas and sectors where we should like to develop closer relations with Brazil .
Economic issues were broached , but you will understand that they were broached in a more general and strategic context , focusing in particular upon issues that are on the agenda within the scope of the talks in the Doha negotiating process .
Clearly , more specific questions will need to be approached at a more technical and more appropriate level .
In the meantime trade issues in general and the concerns which both the EU and Brazil have regarding those issues were approached with great openness and frankness , with each party expressing its points of view and expressing the hope that the Doha negotiating process can be brought to a successful conclusion .
I take that answer as a ' no ' to Mrs McGuinness ' question ; that you did not trouble to press the Brazilian authorities about the lamentable health standards pertaining to their beef exports and the total lack of traceability in respect of their livestock herds .
It will come as a grave disappointment to farming and consumer interests across Europe that , when you had the opportunity , you failed to press this all-important issue .
When is the Council going to wake up to the health implications for the citizens of Europe and press Brazil for realistic traceability in respect of their livestock ?
Furthermore , on 28 July 2006 the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation initialled a bilateral agreement on cooperation in fisheries and the conservation of the living marine resources in the Baltic Sea .
That agreement is due to be signed and come into force in the near future as soon as the Russian Federation has completed its domestic procedures for signature .
That agreement covers all the waters of the Baltic Sea and its straits , but excludes internal waters .
Notwithstanding the geographical area of application of the agreement , Article 13 provides that the Parties may agree to extend cooperation on the management of anadromous and catadromous species , but excludes species which live their entire life cycle in internal waters .
Consequently , as Community law stands , the Council can only recommend that the honourable Member address her question to the European Commission , so that the matter is raised in the context of the bilateral agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation as soon as that agreement enters into force .
( ET ) But the reply as it relates to Lake Peipsi does not entirely satisfy me : in terms of size it is the third largest lake in the European Union and the only one where a professional fishing industry operates .
It is not a body of water internal to Estonia , but a border lake with a third country , namely Russia .
Where prudent exploitation of fish stocks is concerned Estonia , a Member State of the European Union , is doing everything in its power to ensure the conservation of stocks in Lake Peipsi .
The same cannot , however , be said for Russia .
As a result I would nevertheless like to hear from the President-in-Office how the Council proposes to influence Russia to conserve Lake Peipsi 's fish stocks as Estonia is doing ?
What sort of specific own responsibility are you able to propose here today as President of the European Union ?
You mentioned the Commission but the reply which you gave was more concerned with seas .
Peipsi is a border lake whose situation is very specific , it is not an internal body of water .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The honourable Member wishes her question to stand and I , unfortunately , have to say that my answer also stands .
I would recommend , as I did at the end of my last speech , that the honourable Member address her question to the European Commission .
Subject : EU-Bosnia relations
Can the Council make a statement giving an up-to-date assessment of EU-Bosnian political relations at this time ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) The political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is in a very delicate phase .
The verdict of the International Court of Justice in the case brought at the end of February by Bosnia-Herzegovina against Serbia and Montenegro on the application of the Convention on Genocide , brought to the surface the antagonisms which seemed to have been to some extent assuaged following the setting up of the Council of Ministers on 9 February .
The EU told the Bosnian authorities that it feared that the deterioration of the political climate in the country , the return of nationalist rhetoric and lack of political will to reach an agreement were endangering the reform process .
Bosnia-Herzegovina needs to operate effectively as a single economic and administrative space in order to ensure progress for its citizens and on the path towards EU membership .
As regards relations with the EU and the stabilisation and association process , the technical talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement were concluded in December , all Member States having given full support to the result of the technical negotiations on that agreement on 3 May .
The conclusion of the talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is being held up by the lack of tangible progress on police reform .
The recently appointed High Representative / EU Special Representative , Miroslav Lajčak , who took up office at the beginning of July , set as his initial and immediate priorities , in line with the concerns of the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council and of the Council of the European Union , the creation of a constructive political climate and the restructuring of the police force .
In that context the High Representative / EU Special Representative is confident that progress can be achieved by the end of this month .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response .
Rather than go through every single issue , I will concentrate on the question of police reform because this is the most urgent matter at the present time .
Are there any proposals from the Council with regard to putting together a team of facilitators to allow the different traditions in Bosnia-Herzegovina to come together to agree a common standard or common code for how the police force should work ?
It already exists in the border protection area but not on the police side .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Thank you for your question , suggestion and opinion .
We are naturally eagerly waiting with great interest to hear what proposals the new Special Representative will present on this matter of reform of the police force in Bosnia-Herzegovina under this chapter of police cooperation .
If they took the form of an item raised by the Special Representative with the Council and of a solution or suggestion from the High Representative - who is working directly on this case which , as you rightly said , is fundamental for the stability of Bosnia-Herzegovina - if such a proposal were made and submitted to us , naturally the Council would consider it .
We think any suggestions , means and proposals that might be of real help in achieving the final and fundamental objective of stability and progress in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be taken into account .
Questions Nos 14 , 15 and 16 have been withdrawn .
As the author is not present , Question No 17 lapses .
Subject : The European Court of Auditors
The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 significantly changed the EU 's institutional framework , incorporating into it the European Court of Auditors ( Article 7 of the Treaty ) .
By making the Court of Auditors one of its fundamental institutions , the Union demonstrated the importance it attached to transparency and the need to improve its work .
The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe also changed the institutional framework , excluding from it the Court of Auditors , which then came under ' other institutions and advisory bodies ' in Title IV , Chapter II of the Treaty .
The ongoing work on a new treaty does not involve plans to amend the ' institutional framework ' , resulting in a deterioration of the status of the European institutions ' external auditor .
Given that the Union should be improving its accountability to citizens , can the Council explain its decision to lower the status of the Court of Auditors ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) This question will probably receive the fastest answer this session because it is not , in fact , within the Council 's brief to comment on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference for the reform of the Treaties which , as we know , began on 23 July 2007 .
( PL ) Mr President , it really does seem to me that this is very much a question for the Council to raise , especially as we are currently talking about a new treaty that is set to revolutionise the new European Union , and placing the Court of Auditors in the section ' other institutions and advisory bodies ' is a clear downgrading of this institution in terms of how it is viewed by citizens .
The control function of the Court of Auditors is not just based on monitoring expenses and checking whether our common funds - the European Union 's public funds - have been properly distributed ; it is the watchdog for budgetary discipline throughout the European Union , including in the Council , Parliament and the European Commission .
Its recommendations and judgments help us all in our work .
The strong position of the Court of Auditors must be clear and evident to all EU citizens , as it is also the institution that confirms citizens ' trust in the EU as a whole .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Naturally I took note of your concerns and comments , but I am here as the representative of the Council .
The Council as such is not empowered to comment on the subject of the Intergovernmental Conference where the Member States sit round a table to discuss given items precisely in their capacity as Member States , that is , independent sovereign states acting completely independently as Member States .
The Council therefore has no competence to comment on that subject .
The Intergovernmental Conference does , however , have its own bodies , its own structures and presidency and naturally due note will be taken , if you so wish , of any suggestions , criticisms and advice you wish to offer on expediting the work within the Intergovernmental Conference .
However , the Council of the European Union as such is not , as I say , entitled to comment on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference in view of the judicial nature of that Conference .
As the authors are not present , Questions Nos 19 and 20 lapse .
Subject : Demarcation between Schengen and non-Schengen Member States
With regard to Ireland and the United Kingdom , Article 4 of Protocol 2 of the Treaty of Amsterdam incorporating the Schengen acquis within the scope of the European Union states that Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , which are not bound by the Schengen acquis , may at any time request to take part in some or all of the provisions of this acquis .
Those Member States have not to date asked to apply the provisions in the Schengen acquis concerning the abolition of control of persons at internal borders .
Since Ireland and the United Kingdom have not made any such request , the Council Presidency can do little with regard to this matter .
Thank you for your reply .
There have been statements by the British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , and the Irish Prime Minister , Bertie Ahern , that both countries needed to end the demarcation between Schengen and non-Schengen .
However , in your reply you say that no formal request has been received from either country .
Has there been any informal request or approach from either the UK or Ireland on this issue , and can you outline for me , if possible , how it might be possible to apply part of the Schengen acquis , rather than all of it ?
I cannot add anything on this question to what I said in my initial contribution .
Naturally the Schengen Agreement contains its own provisions and articles on the application and scope of application of the agreement , and we must abide by those articles and provisions .
Subject : Establishment of EU-Israel Subcommittee on Human Rights
In November 2005 the EU-Israel Subcommittee on Political Dialogue and Cooperation established an EU-Israel human rights working group .
Will the Council consider upgrading the EU-Israel human rights working group into a subcommittee on human rights which would meet more regularly than the working group ( which up to February 2007 had met on only two occasions ) and which could hold regular and systematic consultations with civil society in Israel , the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the EU to assess the human rights situation in Israel and the OPT ?
President-in-Office of the Council ( PT ) . - The EU-Israel human rights working group , set up at the meeting of the EU-Israel Subcommittee on Political Dialogue and Cooperation on 21 November 2005 , is the platform which makes it possible to make a regular , systematic and in-depth analysis as well as for both parties to debate human rights issues , as the honourable Member wishes , and as the Council itself wishes .
Moreover , human rights is a constant theme at all levels of the ongoing political contact between the EU and Israel .
Civil society organisations , as mentioned in the honourable Member 's question , are already making a contribution to such exchanges .
Quite honestly , that is a non-answer .
I asked if the working group , which has met only twice since 2005 , would be upgraded to a subcommittee on human rights .
After 40 years of occupation of the Palestinian territories , there are clearly persistent breaches of Palestinian human rights as a result of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories .
I ask the Council to indicate what its attitude is to upgrading the human rights working group to a subcommittee , which would meet regularly and keep some kind of pressure on the Israeli authorities to comply with human rights norms , which we all expect civilised societies and democracies to comply with .
I should like to tell the honourable Member , as I said , that respect for and protection of human rights are constant themes in dialogue between the EU and third countries .
It is one of the Council 's concerns and an ongoing and constant concern of the successive presidencies of the Council and that also applies to the Portuguese Presidency .
Portugal is particularly attentive to human rights , for its own historical reasons .
Only yesterday I had the opportunity to point out here to some honourable Members of the European Parliament that , since we ourselves had a dictatorship in Portugal until 1974 , we are particularly sensitive to anything relating to democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
Those topics are particularly dear to our hearts and therefore feature in our dialogue with third countries , including Israel ; we shall always include those points in the regular dialogue that we have with the Israeli authorities .
Subject : Situation in Zimbabwe
The political and economic situation in Zimbabwe has reportedly assumed ' life-threatening proportions ' .
The police have arrested more than 1 300 shop keepers and managers who refused to halve the price of their products , as President Mugabe 's government had instructed .
Halving prices has led to panic buying at large chains of stores .
Essentials such as sugar , cooking oil and bread are now obtainable only on the black market .
Petrol stations are dry .
According to eye witnesses , many shops have been looted by government party supporters .
Inflation - the highest in the world - is the result of the never-ending printing of money with which the Government pays civil servants , police officers and soldiers .
According to the opposition party MDC , the Government is attempting , nine months ahead of the presidential elections , to secure the votes of the poor .
Representatives of the Zanu-PF government party are reported to have dismissed a request by South African President Mbeki to go to Pretoria .
What is the position of the Council ?
Will it call on the Government to shoulder its responsibilities in the crisis to a greater extent ?
The Council is closely monitoring the critical political and economic situation in Zimbabwe .
The Council debated this issue at its meeting on 23 April 2007 and obtained further information on the problem at its meeting on 22 July , therefore very recently .
The Council 's strategy has been public knowledge ever since the restrictive measures were first introduced .
In 2002 the Council decided to introduce restrictive measures against Zimbabwe 's leaders declaring that , as long as human rights continued to be violated the Council would deem it necessary to maintain restrictive measures against the Zimbabwe Government and against those responsible for such violations , and for infringement of the right to freedom of opinion , association and peaceful assembly .
Furthermore , the Council stated that such measures would be revoked only when the conditions were in place to guarantee respect for human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law .
In response to the recent acts of violence and violation of human rights , on 23 April the Council decided to extend the visa ban list .
Since the introduction of the restrictive measures the Council has tried to involve the Africa 's multilateral institutions .
The Council has systematically included the question of Zimbabwe on the agenda for all ministerial meetings organised with SADC ever since the measures were introduced .
The EU also raised the question of Zimbabwe with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights .
The Council praised in particular the initiative of SADC and the mandate given to President Mbeki to facilitate dialogue between the opposition and the Government , as well as the appointment of Mr Kikwete as Chair of the SADC organ .
The Council is looking forward to seeing the first results of these African initiatives ; if appropriate it will review its position accordingly .
( NL ) Mr President , the situation in Zimbabwe is gradually becoming hopeless - and that is putting it mildly .
Sadly , the international community , including the EU , is standing by helplessly .
I should like to put a brief supplementary question to the Council , as the Portuguese Presidency is organising an EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon on 8 and 9 December .
This has not been possible in recent years , as agreement could not be reached on the issue of whether or not to invite President Mugabe .
My question is very specific , and I expect a similarly specific reply : is the Presidency intending to invite President Mugabe to Lisbon in December ?
Secondly , in what way is the Council hoping to raise the situation in Zimbabwe at the Summit ?
As I said , the EU has been closely monitoring the situation in Zimbabwe and has taken the measures it considers most appropriate in that respect .
In turn the European Council has always made it understood in the conclusions of its meetings that it is of strategic importance for the European Union to keep up a global , comprehensive and detailed dialogue with Africa as a whole .
It is that mandate , which we are given by the European Council , which reflects the interest in and the commitment to this global dialogue which we must hold with the African countries because we have much to discuss , but also to cooperate on , with Africa .
It is with that objective and that intention that the Portuguese Presidency is determined to conduct the second EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December .
We are convinced that that Summit is in our interest and in the interest of the other Member States , in the interest of the EU and also of Africa .
With Africa we have to discuss immigration , the economy , trade , energy , the climate , and also naturally human rights and good governance , subjects which we have already been discussing and which were also debated and discussed at the first Summit held in Cairo in 2000 during Portugal 's previous Presidency .
It is an objective which we set for our Presidency and it is an objective which we intend to continue to work towards in close cooperation with our partners , both within the EU and also in Africa .
Subject : North European Gas Pipeline
During the German EU Presidency , a representative of that country stated that ' Nord Stream ' was a project involving private companies and over which the EU had no influence .
On 15 July 2007 , in an interview given to Lithuanian television , the German Foreign Minister , Frank-Walter Steinmeier , stated that Nord Stream was not a German and Russian project but a trans-European project .
The EU would oppose the project if Lithuania 's energy and ecological interests were damaged .
What is the opinion of the Portuguese Presidency on the matter ?
Is Nord Stream a private project or an EU project ?
What is its place in the future common EU energy policy ?
With regard to the points raised by the honourable Member and to the first question , the Council would point out that it does not comment on reports in the media .
Secondly , and in reply to the second question , the Council would remind the honourable Member that the ' Nord Stream ' project is a private project being carried out by ' Nord Stream AG ' as a joint venture .
Moreover , as the Council mentioned in its answer to Oral Question by Nils Lundgren on the Russo-German gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea , the development of a pipeline between Russia and Germany through the Baltic Sea was declared a project of European interest in Decision No 1364 / 2006 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council .
For a more detailed explanation of that declaration , the Council would refer the honourable Member to the answer to that question .
On the third question , the Council would point out that the construction of a new gas pipeline in the north of Europe along that route is in accordance with the objective of the European Union 's energy policy to improve the Community 's security of supply .
Effective diversification of energy sources and transport routes was mentioned in the European Council 's Community action plan of March 2007 as one of the means of improving security of supply .
The Community acquis will always be applied in its entirety whenever necessary , including in particular Community legislation on the environment , to those parts of the gas pipeline built within the territory of the EU Member States .
( LT ) I find it difficult to understand whether it is a private project or an EU project .
The gas pipeline is laid through the Baltic Sea and not just two , but several countries are located near it .
There is a great danger that weapons lying on the seabed will be raised .
The project has not even got off the ground , yet Russia and Germany have already changed the route .
I would like to say that it is now difficult to understand whose project it is .
Is it a private project or an EU project ?
The gas pipeline is laid through the Baltic Sea and not just two , but several countries are located near it .
There is a great danger that weapons lying on the seabed will be raised .
The project has not even got off the ground , yet Russia and Germany have already changed the route because it was discovered that there is a huge accumulation of weapons dating from the Second World War close to Denmark , Finland , Estonia and Sweden .
Can it be a private project if it creates not only an energy supply problem - that is , a gas supply problem - for nearby countries , but also an ecological problem in the Baltic Sea ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) On this question , I do not have much to add to what I said in my first answer , that is specifically to repeat our promise that the Community acquis will be applied in its entirety whenever necessary and always when environmental questions are at issue .
I hope , therefore , that our statement allays and provides a response to the concerns which the honourable Member expressed .
Subject : Mordechai Vanunu sentenced to six months in prison
On 2 July 2007 , Mordechai Vanunu - a former nuclear technician and a pacifist for over 20 years - was sentenced by the Jerusalem Magistrates ' Court to six months in prison for ( according to the Israeli authorities ) breaching the terms of an administrative order restricting his freedom of speech and freedom of movement .
Vanunu was abducted in Rome and transferred to Israel , where he was imprisoned and accused of high treason for having spoken to the Sunday Times about Israel 's nuclear weapons programme .
He was tried in camera and sentenced to 18 years in prison , 11 of which were to be spent in solitary confinement .
On his release from prison in 2004 , significant restrictions were placed ( pursuant to the above-mentioned order ) on his freedom : in particular , he was denied any contact with people from countries other than Israel and he was not allowed to approach embassies and consulates , own a mobile telephone , access the Internet or leave Israel .
What action is the Council intending to take vis-à-vis the Israeli authorities in response to these violations of the fundamental rights of free speech and free movement ?
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( PT ) As may be seen from our answers to questions , , and , the Council is following with interest the case of Mordechai Vanunu , especially his situation following his release in 2004 , mentioned by the honourable Member in her question .
Subject : Progress on the Temporary Agency Workers Directive
What are the results of the initial consultations undertaken by the Portuguese Presidency with a view to seeking agreement on the draft Temporary Agency Workers Directive ?
Does the President-in-Office expect to put the amended proposal for a directive to a vote in the Council during the current Presidency , and which timetable has he set down for informal and formal negotiations in relation to this ?
I should like to tell you that , as a result of preliminary consultations with the Member States , the Portuguese Presidency decided to reopen the debates on the proposal for a directive on temporary agency workers , which it regards as an important element in the debate on flexicurity .
Since this dossier has not been examined by the Council since 2004 , it is important to take stock of the current stage reached and to reflect upon the possible courses to be followed .
The Presidency will shortly be taking measures to that end .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for the warm words that he gave .
Indeed , flexicurity is a good principle , as we say in this Chamber and in the European institutions .
However , many people say that flexibility we see a lot of , but where is the security ?
The Temporary Agency Workers Directive remains a real test of whether there is to be that security aspect .
I wonder what the President-in-Office thinks are the blockages at the moment , within the European Council of Ministers , that are preventing progress being made .
Despite the good offices of the Presidency , how confident is he that the Council will indeed be able to reach agreement during the term of office of our Portuguese colleagues ?
I thank the honourable Member for his question .
As I indicated , this is a dossier that the Portuguese Presidency wants to work on and take forward .
We have always said that the success of a presidency depends in the first place on the presidency itself , but that it must also rely on the commitment , cooperation and will to move forward of all the Member States .
This is one case which we could not possibly bring to a safe harbour , so to speak , without all the Member States on our side .
We should be pleased if , during the Portuguese Presidency , we could at least make significant progress even if we cannot reach full agreement .
We shall work towards that in the hope , as I said , that our partners will be able to accept our suggestions and proposals , whilst also taking a realistic approach to this question , because we know that this is a complex debate and a complex issue , as the history of this Directive shows .
As regards flexicurity , I can tell you that for Portugal and for this Portuguese Presidency flexicurity means flexibility but also security and for us the two go together .
Thank you very much .
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing ( see Annex ) .
That concludes Question Time .

Human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries ( debate )
The next item is the report by Mrs Valenciano Martínez-Orozco , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , on the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Madam President , the birth of the European Union was inspired by inalienable values .
In the same way that we keep a close watch on our Member States to make sure that they do not violate the right to freedom , or to life , or to democracy , we must have a decisive influence through dialogue on those countries with whom we have political , trade , economic or partnership relations , etc . , so that they also respect human rights .
Within the complexity and magnitude of the EU 's external relations , the space occupied by dialogue and human rights consultations with third countries could go unnoticed or remain in the background .
If that were the case , and we were to allow it , we would be making a very serious mistake .
This report deals with the aspects that are necessary to improve a task that is an EU obligation , according to EU Article 11 of the EU Treaty , and which also comes under political ethics .
Human rights should be the banner of EU external policy and the EU should use its influence to improve the living conditions of people in the countries with which it has relations .
This is one of the key political elements in this report .
When we sit down to negotiate economic or trade agreements with a country in which fundamental rights are violated , we cannot put figures , agreements and contracts on the table while shamefully brushing under the carpet the situation that its citizens are going through .
If we leave human rights outside the negotiating room , we will be falling into the most macabre cynicism .
We also need to take a close look at the role played by civil society and human rights defenders , significant voices that are essential for progress in all oppressed societies .
The report we are debating today evaluates one of the main instruments that the European Union has for achieving the objectives I have mentioned and also for clearly defining the role that we want to play in the world order .
It is only through respect and reciprocity that we can make progress in the task of promoting human rights .
There is absolutely no question of acting through imposition and paternalism .
We are not in a position to give lectures to anyone , but we do have an obligation to maintain consistency in our external actions and to promote relations with those countries that are making progress , avoiding imbalances and à la carte treatment that undermine our credibility .
The report that I am presenting to this House calls for action on three levels : more consistency in conducting dialogues and consultations , which will require greater coordination between the Council , whose absence from this debate I regret , the Commission and Parliament , using a mechanism to facilitate smooth communication and avoid contradictions between the various Community institutions .
It is about us really speaking with one clear voice .
It is also about transparency in the management of dialogues and consultations which , in the field of human rights , should be a principle , not an exception .
The flexibility and pragmatism required in order to achieve specific results should not obscure the picture regarding the agenda , objectives or the result of dialogue .
We are calling for the European Parliament 's role to be strengthened , which , ladies and gentlemen , is what is really lacking in the management of this instrument , without there being any legal or formal justification for this .
The European Parliament is prepared to act responsibly in the area of its external powers .
This House has established itself as the key European institution in the field of human rights , making them its focus , and it is resolved to use every method available to it to carry out its role as the political guarantor of the external action of the Union .
The European Parliament urges the Commission and the Council to listen to and put into practice the recommendations of this report , which are widely supported by all the political groups in this House .
Ladies and gentlemen , Parliament 's voice must be heard .
We know that what we are asking for will require a great deal of effort , and we are therefore considering the need to extend the resources allocated to human rights units , both in the Commission and in the Council , the latter not being present at this debate .
However , this is the minimum requirement for a European Union that claims to uphold before the world that human rights are an inalienable European right .
If we want to be credible , we need to work together towards this .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , the report prepared by the rapporteur , Ms Valenciano Martínez-Orozco , and the resolution before Parliament address a highly important but also increasingly complex instrument of the European Union 's external human rights policy .
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner ( who regrets not to be able to attend this debate today ) had accordingly instructed her services to lend every support to the rapporteur in her difficult task of scrutinising the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries .
The report adds a further building block to Parliament 's remarkable work in assessing the EU toolbox on human rights , through its regular annual reports , the Agnoletto report on human rights clauses , the study of the European Inter-University Centre on the impact of Parliament 's activities in the field of human rights , as well as the study on the guidelines on torture .
The report also usefully complements the regular review of the human rights dialogues and consultations undertaken by the Council and by the Commission .
The Commission would like to compliment the rapporteur and Parliament on its report and the detailed analysis and recommendations devoted to the European Union 's human rights dialogues and consultations .
The Commission takes the view that , of all human rights instruments at our disposal , it is the dialogues that probably provide the best chance to secure positive , long-term results in the development of the respect for human rights worldwide , as long as we are prepared to invest sufficient time and energy in them .
We firmly believe that the European Union can obtain success in advancing the human rights record of third countries only through patient work of bridge-building and persuasion , and this not just in its bilateral relations but also in the framework of multilateral bodies , as developments in the Human Rights Council demonstrate .
The great variety and number of European Union human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries - which , moreover , are steadily increasing - make any global evaluation very arduous .
Structured dialogues , such as with China ; agreement-based dialogues like those with many neighbourhood countries ; consultations with like-minded partners , such as with the US and Canada , or local troika dialogues with a range of countries all differ in many respects , be it their periodicity , the policy level , the kind of interlocutors , the depth of the discussions or the fact that some are combined with civil society events and others are not .
Far from being a shortcoming of the instrument , the Commission sees such variety as proof of the dynamism and potential of the dialogue instrument and an asset that should be preserved .
The EU guidelines on human rights dialogues and the Cotonou ( ACP-EU ) Agreement both stress the importance of flexibility to take into account the different country situations , their evolution over time and the dynamic relationships between any given third country and the European Union .
Therefore , while keeping common base lines and targets for the dialogue , it would not be advisable to strictly align all their modalities .
For this instrument to be effective it needs to be tailor-made and able to adapt to changing circumstances .
It also needs to be borne in mind that the various dialogues and consultations are in different stages of maturity .
The dialogue with China or the consultations with like-minded countries have developed more or less consolidated modalities over several years and therefore allow for rather intensive , deep discussions .
In other cases , such as the dialogues with neighbourhood countries , we are still polishing the instrument and are in the phase of building up the necessary confidence to allow for genuinely meaningful exchanges .
We are therefore confident that , also in these cases , issues such as the desirable participation of experts from line ministries , involvement of civil society or the consideration of individual cases will eventually become possible once the exercise finds its own solid ground .
Finally , you can rest assured that the recommendations directed at the Commission will be examined carefully , and you can count on our commitment to improve the information to Parliament in order to allow for increased transparency of human rights dialogues and consultations .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for her report .
I am pleased that she has taken such full account of the recommendation I made in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality .
Particular attention needs to be paid to the role of women in human rights dialogues with third countries where their health and safety is concerned .
Human rights include the right of women to make decisions concerning their lives and reproduction free of discrimination , coercion and violence .
Sadly , human rights dialogues still take insufficient account of this .
on behalf of the PPE-DE . - ( RO ) Madam President , on behalf of the European People 's Party I welcome the drawing up of this report which is of major importance for the future of EU dialogue and consultations with third countries and for the role of the European Parliament .
Above all , the European Union is a union of democratic values promoting peace , tolerance and respect for human rights .
Therefore , it is crucial that any dialogue started and carried out with third countries focuses on the need to guarantee and protect fundamental freedoms and human rights , not only in Europe but in the whole world .
This report aims at proposing solution for improving the operation of EU dialogue and consultations with third countries in the field of human rights .
Therefore , the report focuses on 3 concepts for enhancing efficiency : dialogue and consultation coherence , transparency and visibility .
The more active involvement of the European Parliament in this process is also important .
I think that the European Parliament has a legitimate right to take part in this dialogue , to perform the democratic scrutiny that is assigned to it by the European citizens .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the kindness analysing within the report the dialogue with neighbouring countries located in the eastern EU .
A major priority of European Union foreign policy is the creation of a real democratic area on our eastern border and dialogue on human rights should be considered as a very important instrument .
The creation of joint subcommissions for human rights would be an important step , for neighbouring countries as well , where a continuous deterioration of human rights is occurring .
I would like to focus on one thing , even if it is not part of the neighbourhood policy .
Russia is another Eastern partner that should finally accept that a direct dialogue in the field of human rights cannot cause but a better life of its own citizens .
I do not want to conclude without mentioning with satisfactory coverage of women 's rights within this report . !
Madam President , the report by Mrs Valenciano concerns an essential aspect of European values : the human rights dialogue .
This dialogue , mentioned in various agreements with many countries and in various instruments , is in a way the signature of the soft power that is Europe .
This report was the subject of a vast consensus .
Today , the only amendments that remain were presented by the Identity , Tradition and Sovereignty Group on the extreme right .
Curiously , all these amendments are signed by my compatriots , members of Vlaams Belang .
But what does this group , which recently made itself rather conspicuous in Brussels by supporting a demonstration against Islam that was banned by the authorities , actually want ?
This is quite interesting .
Firstly , they want to restrict human rights to civil and political rights and are removing social , environmental , economic and cultural rights from the text .
While invoking the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , they neglect to say that at the same time , the same UN General Assembly voted in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which they are quick to forget about .
Secondly , they are proposing to link genital mutilation , early marriage and trafficking in human beings with religious practices - undoubtedly Islam - which is a crude link to make .
No way !
These practices are reprehensible ; they may be cultural , perhaps tribal , but they are criminal and are not in any way religious .
Finally , thirdly , the ITS has a go at Turkey in a tirade against the party of Messrs Erdogan and Gül that singularly lacks any basis .
To conclude , the report by Mrs Valenciano is a remarkable report , open but at the same time very firm .
It is anything but angelic .
Just read paragraph 22 , which states that human rights dialogue should always be backed up by diplomatic pressure at every level , and I am talking to the Council !
It is a pity that certain extremist groups are using it as a platform for their intolerance and hatred .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I should like to commend Mrs Valenciano on her well-balanced report , and to thank her for being so obliging in incorporating many of the amendments presented by our committee .
The result is a clear , thorough report , which contains a number of good recommendations for strengthening the EU 's human rights dialogues with third countries and promoting human rights and democracy .
The EU must enhance its role as a proactive actor when it comes to promoting human rights , and so I am pleased that the Council has taken the initiative in incorporating human rights into EU policy .
It is good that the European Parliament is advocating the systematic inclusion of human rights issues in the agenda of the EU 's political dialogues and external policy .
It is only by systematising the dialogues that we can improve the use of benchmarks and bring coherence to endeavours to promote human rights .
However , the EU should not lay down such exacting requirements that the dialogue , drowning in requirements to report against indicators , forgets to pursue its original objectives .
Dialogue must be used to open up an engaging , confidence-inspiring political space that , rather than only ever identifying violations , also identifies progress in the human rights field .
We must recognise that the human rights dialogues face major challenges .
The human rights situation in a number of countries gives cause for concern .
It is crucial to the EU 's relations with important trading partners that we attach increased importance to linking trading relations to human rights reforms .
Trade agreements with third countries should be seen as a tool with consequences reaching beyond the purely economic .
Environmental and human rights issues must be incorporated from the outset and be placed on an equal footing with economic issues .
The dialogue with third countries must help strengthen democratic , social , political and environmental rights , and therefore it should also be made clear that trade agreements must contain an unambiguous mechanism for how and when agreements can be suspended in the event that one trading partner fails to comply with human rights or democracy clauses .
There can be no doubt , however , that the greatest progress is achieved by giving third countries an incentive to comply with the political and economic requirements that form part of agreements .
We must strike a balance in bilateral dialogues , whereby we can still exert pressure but have reciprocity and genuine dialogue as a cornerstone .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , as I believe Mrs Valenciano has shown very clearly in her excellent report , we are overflowing with concrete proposals that will certainly be very useful to the Portuguese Presidency , as it has stated its aim to achieve tangible results on human rights and democracy .
We have for some time been calling for greater coherence , transparency and results in our discussions with third countries , jointly with the Commission and the Council .
All that remains is actually to go from words to action .
I am convinced that you know as well as I do that all it takes is organisation to make human rights dialogues more effective , beyond their diversity .
Firstly , this means setting up clear , public objectives assigned to each dialogue so that a coherent , shared strategy , appropriated at the highest level , emerges .
Secondly , it means setting up indicators to allow proper evaluation of the results achieved by a dialogue and informing MEPs of them so that , for example when a delegation visits the country , they can check what progress has been made and discuss it with civil society and human rights activists , to be better able to question their partners on the commitments made within the framework of the dialogue .
On this score , we are still waiting to be informed of the indicators that should be used to evaluate the dialogue recently established with Uzbekistan .
Thirdly , it means guaranteeing that human rights are taken into account in all the EU 's external policies , including trade policy , migration policy and the fight against terrorism .
It is our credibility in talking about human rights that is at stake here .
For example , can anyone explain how we can currently be discussing the implementation of guidelines against torture with Jordan in the Subcommittee on Human Rights , the first subcommittee to be set up under the neighbourhood policy , today held up as a model , when we know that European Member States have covered up the subcontracting of torture by the CIA ?
How can we be discussing torture and the fight against it in this subcommittee ?
Our first job as MEPs is to evaluate the pertinence of the EU 's action , and to do this , you can count on the delegations , the committees and the whole Parliament , which will continue to fight for its application every step of the way , whether it means launching , reorientating or , if necessary , stopping a dialogue .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mrs Valenciano very much because one of the things her weighty report highlights is the steps that the European Union still has to take in consultations on human rights , and thus the fact that this is a work in progress for all of us .
I believe that her request for greater consistency and transparency for all is vital , as well as greater involvement by civil society in foreign policy .
Above all , it is important to confirm the end and not the beginning of a policy which in many cases is based on double standards .
Mrs Flautre , for example , referred to the issue of torture .
It also seems to me very important to plan greater coordination between the various bodies and to create subcommittees , and above all to step up cooperation with national parliaments and the European Commission 's delegations across the world .
I believe , however , that in the issue of double standards what is important is the fact that even we , acting as the European Union , do not implement the agreements we sign .
I am thinking , for instance , of Article 2 of the association agreements .
I agree , however , on a point put by Mrs De Keyser on the amendments made .
We thank Mrs Valenciano for having accepted many of our amendments .
Those tabled are negative except for one amendment , which was tabled not by any group but by Mrs Flautre , concerning increased monitoring and a greater presence and coherence in post-electoral phases .
I also believe , as Mrs Valenciano says , that the Commission and the Council ought to increase Parliament 's involvement in the political dialogue process , take into account our opinion and provide us with more information , more consistently , both during and after negotiations with third countries , as provided for in any case by Articles 21 and 24 of the Treaty .
I also believe that , in general , the response to this issue needs to involve not only the announcement of actions , but also an investment in staff , which is extremely important .
For example I recall , with sadness , a question put by the European Parliament recently : the Conference of Presidents rejected a request to have a committee on human rights with full powers .
I believe that this was a mistake , because it would have been an excellent opportunity to see and give an idea of the strength and capacity of mainstreaming .
Madam President , the rapporteur has produced a significant report .
The promotion of human rights in countries with which the EU has relations is a task it must perform responsibly .
Structured human rights dialogues are indeed of great importance in this regard .
Precisely because of this , and in connection with this report , it is sad to note that last May 's Expert Seminar with China did not take place .
The maintenance of good Sino-European relations requires commitment on both sides , however .
Recent alarming reports by organisations such as Amnesty International , Psy , Human Rights in China and Compass Direct give me cause to question this commitment .
' Opponents ' , including religious minorities and journalists , are banished to psychiatric institutions for political ends .
The infamous Ankang system is a reality in China , particularly in the run-up to the Olympic Games .
That is most regrettable .
Therefore , I would ask the Council and the Commission to keep their fingers on the pulse with regard to the human rights situation in the Middle Kingdom .
Maintaining harmonious relations with the strategic partner that is the People 's Republic of China is important , but not at all costs , so that practice joins theory with regard to the following words of the report : ' whereas human rights dialogues [ ... ] constitute an essential part of the European Union 's overall strategy aimed at promoting sustainable development , peace and stability . '
( SK ) Firstly , I too would like to thank my fellow Member Mrs Valenciano for her work on a topic that represents the most important human rights tool and as such is very sensitive ; unfortunately it does not often get the attention it deserves .
That is why I agree with the point of view expressed in this report , namely that more attention should be paid to the reforms implemented by partner states in matters of human rights and democracy .
I think that the European Union will have to do all in its power to develop a more efficient and unanimous response in the area of international cooperation and dialogue with third countries .
I am pleased that the report defends and endorses the systematic integration of the protection of the rights of women and children in all dialogues and consultations on human rights between the European Union and third countries .
As a rapporteur for the Subcommittee on Human Rights , I am working on a strategy relating to the rights of children .
In my report I stress the need for the individual provisions on children in armed conflicts to complement one other , and the need to take account of the Paris commitments to protect children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups .
I would like to emphasise the need to step up the controls over the assistance provided by the European Union , for example as a part of humanitarian aid , in order to avoid the possibility of funds provided by the European Union for education or medical care for children being used to buy small light arms that can be used by children .
Dialogue must not be limited only to matters of democracy or protection of civic and political rights ; it must also encompass those issues that directly concern the European Union , for example environmental issues or health protection issues .
It is important to set clear criteria for the initiation , suspension or termination of a political dialogue and to define the goals we want to achieve .
In order to achieve our goals we must engage in a dialogue and not just dictate something unilaterally to third countries ; we must endeavour to establish constructive cooperation ; and we must cooperate with local human rights organisations and with non-governmental organisations operating in the countries in question .
Additional EU financial support must be provided and it must be conditional on respect for human rights : payment of funds to countries where human rights are not observed must be stopped or suspended .
Madam President , the Valenciano Martínez-Orozco report on promoting human rights and democracy remains a fundamental cornerstone of the EU and the common values that unite the 27 Member States .
It is also a key component externally in our strategic alliances beyond , in the wider 47-member-state Council of Europe , in our transatlantic partnership in NATO and with like-minded countries within the UN .
Inevitably , as the Union has progressed with more and more formal trade and political cooperation agreements , we have sought to impose a degree of fundamental human rights conditionality on our global partners - albeit it ad hoc and inconsistent at best - aided by a specific instrument , the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights , and supported by human rights dialogues and consultations when required .
The European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) , for which I am co-rapporteur for Parliament , aims at establishing a ring of neighbouring friends committed to a common area of peace , stability , security , full respect for human rights and democracy , freedom of the press , independence of the judiciary , the rule of law and prosperity .
ENP action plans build on the existing , legally binding under the Treaty , contractual frameworks - association agreements in the case of Euromed partners or partnership and cooperation agreements with former Soviet states - which typically include human rights and democracy clauses that are monitored so that , the closer the ENP partner country comes in terms of shared values , the greater the aid and trade cooperation granted by the EU .
These action plans are monitored by subcommittees as part of an ongoing dialogue .
Theoretically , at least , geopolitical considerations should play no part , but in fact realpolitik usually prevails in practice .
Who , for instance , would dare threaten the same degree of sanctions against the People 's Republic of China , as mentioned by my colleague Mr Belder , over its serious lack of human rights and democracy as we did against Uzbekistan ?
That is my case .
( Applause )
( PL ) Madam President , may I begin by congratulating my colleague Elena Valenciano Martínez-Orozco on preparing the report on the functioning of the human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries .
Today 's report concerns one of the European Union 's most important policies .
As far as the European Parliament is concerned , human rights policy is the trademark of European policy .
Today 's report deals with this area in an exceptionally profound and thorough way .
I wish to draw attention to the report 's recommendations for the Council and the Commission .
First of all we are highlighting the need for increased interinstitutional coherence , to find ways of improving coordination among the different EU institutions ( the Council , the Commission and Parliament ) .
Human rights policy really must be coordinated at a general EU level .
We must put a stop to the practice whereby each of the most important EU institutions acts in this area in some sense , if I may use the phrase , on its own initiative .
Dialogue and consultation objectives should be based on the principle that human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent .
We recommend that the criteria to be established should encompass not only civil and political rights , but also economic , social , environmental and cultural rights .
The report emphasises the enhancement of the European Parliament 's role in EU human rights policy .
This is a demand that reoccurs in every report accepted by this House in the area of human rights .
The demand is clear - the European Parliament must be at the centre of a system of the most important European institutions , in which EU human rights policy is concentrated , as it is the institution that derives from democratic elections and possesses a political moral right to take a fundamental interest in this matter .
We also consider it essential to increase the role of interparliamentary assemblies and interparliamentary delegations in human rights dialogues and consultations .
Finally , we insist that women 's rights are an integral part of human rights and urge the Commission to include the promotion and protection of women 's rights explicitly and systematically in all areas relating to human rights that fall within the European Union 's remit .
( FR ) Madam President , I would first like to congratulate Mrs Valenciano on this report , which combines courage and ambition and I support her in all her proposals .
Indeed , this report reaffirms the universality of human rights and anchors them as fundamental principles of the European Union 's relations with third countries .
However , although it is important to affirm and reaffirm the universality of human rights today , it is just as important , and even high time , to shed another dogma of international politics , and this is the illusion we use too often to reassure ourselves , namely that economic development will lead to democratisation and the safeguarding of human rights .
The last few decades paint a different picture .
Indeed we must notice that there is a two-speed evolution going on : on the one hand , we are currently seeing rampant globalisation at the economic level , and on the other , the sudden surge in democratisation , which produced democracies in Europe , Latin America and East Asia at the end of the Cold War , seems to be running out of steam .
Instead , we should be noticing that all over the world , economic growth and authoritarian regimes often go together .
On the contrary , rapid economic growth even seems to give these regimes legitimacy and to contribute to the stabilisation of their power .
Today quite rightly we are focusing our interest and concern on the human rights situation in the large emerging countries such as China and Russia .
Do not be deceived , though : several of the countries that number among the most developed in the world - including some that are our economic allies - do not respect the fundamental rights of their citizens .
I am thinking particularly of Singapore , a country with a prosperous and modern economy , whose population benefits from all the advantages of a developed country except political freedoms , and more specifically , freedom of expression and assembly .
Madam President , if proof of this were still needed , it was given in a way that could not have been clearer by the behaviour of the Singapore authorities towards a delegation of MEPs from my group in April this year , a delegation of which I was a member .
The local authorities prevented us from speaking at a meeting with members of the Singapore liberal party under threat of arrest .
This experience , as disturbing as it may have been , was also very revealing and it once again confirmed to me that protecting human rights does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with economic development , and that the European Union , as it happens , cannot just make do with an economic approach towards the countries concerned .
On the contrary , the European Union should continue to play its role of defending human rights and to remind foreign leaders constantly that human rights are for all humans all over the world .
( PL ) Madam President , the promotion of human rights is the main pillar of the European Union 's external policy .
I agree with the rapporteur that the Council and the Commission should systematically incorporate human rights issues into the European Union 's programme for political dialogue with third countries .
It would also be a good idea to ensure that human rights are more frequently incorporated into all areas of the Union 's external policy , including the external aspects of its internal policy .
All available instruments should be used to achieve this aim .
In this respect I think it would be good to make more use of the European Parliament .
For example , the Council could send Parliament and the relevant committee six-monthly evaluations of each dialogue and consultation held , together with an explanation that places emphasis on trends in the progress of work , and not on individual results .
It would also be appropriate to introduce a routine consultation session involving Members of the European Parliament after each round of dialogue and consultation .
This would give Members the opportunity to take part in key decisions relating to the continuation or suspension of a specific dialogue .
I also think that it would be a good idea to include Members in the decision-making process on the instigation of a new dialogue and to inform them about the aim , forms or procedures for its institution .
I also consider that , in order to make their actions more effective , the Council and the Commission should incorporate recommendations and conclusions in Parliament resolutions , especially resolutions on human rights , into their dialogue agendas .
( ES ) Madam President , in the space of a minute and a half I would like to summarise some of the fundamental ideas that have led us not only to support , but also to clearly champion this initiative , and of course to congratulate Elena Valenciano on her work and on the capacity for reaching consensus that she has demonstrated .
I would also like to welcome the presence and interest shown by Mr Borg , as well as the presence of Mr Mattisen , but at the same time I regret the fact that the first two seats belonging to the Council are empty .
I believe that the Council should have been present for this debate and as has already been said , this must be stated and reiterated .
The three topics that I think it is important to highlight , in any case , and which I would like to mention , are , firstly , the need , which we can never state strongly enough , to improve the consistency of these instruments , to reinforce the fact that we cannot , on the one hand , lament certain events , and on the other hand keep quiet when it suits our interests .
The second thing that I think is important , which has also been mentioned , but I would like to reiterate it , is the need for greater transparency in this type of mechanism , which requires increased participation by Parliament .
It has been said many times that we are completely surprised , for want of a better word and to put it mildly , at what is missing from many of these debates , not only simply in terms of participation , but also in terms of the information that we often require .
Last but not least , is the important role in this report of the 14 paragraphs dedicated to the role of women in human rights , and as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , I would like to celebrate the fact that many of the amendments that we discussed and adopted in committee have been taken on board .
( Applause )
( NL ) Madam President , the widely supported emphasis on human rights is relatively new .
Previously , this emphasis chiefly derived from socialist or liberal inspiration .
The left was mainly concerned with the right to housing , income , facilities , codecision , a healthy environment , peace and liberation from colonial occupation - and all this not only for those already enjoying the right to it , but particularly for all those not yet able , or insufficiently able , to exercise that right .
Liberals were chiefly concerned with individual freedoms and the right of entrepreneurship .
For some other political forces , human rights were less important .
Even now that there is greater agreement than before on the importance of human rights , there is still a gap between ideals and reality .
Acting out of self-interest , the richest , most democratic countries tend to prioritise support to regimes that guarantee supplies of gas and oil and attempt at domestic level to destroy the movements that conflict most with Western interests .
Applying double standards is an invitation to discredit justified criticism of some other countries as useless , arrogant interference .
The Valenciano Martínez-Orozco report rightly points out that endlessly pursuing human rights dialogues with reluctant governments is not a valid objective , and that such dialogues must not be allowed to founder in a lack of transparency and democratic control .
This report enjoys a broad consensus ; the suggested amendments primarily originate from three Flemish Members from the Identity , Tradition and Sovereignty Group in the European Parliament .
The shortcomings they identify are mostly correct , but the wordings and deletions they suggest give the impression that this is not a matter of seeking solutions , but of being resigned to the lack of results .
It is an illusion to believe that Europe would be better to shut itself off from the rest of the world in order to guarantee peace and quiet , prosperity and security on its own territory .
Amendments that do not contribute to equality and democracy for all and to solidarity with the poor and hungry of the world will not have our support .
Madam President , we in the EU set great store by human rights .
We try to inspire the nations with which we interact to have a good level of human rights also .
Dialogue is an important starting-point , but in this dialogue we must be willing to risk even economic advantage in order to speak courageously and truthfully .
China comes into this report ; we know of serious cases of political and religious persecution there .
Two years ago , in China , I met a psychiatrist who was chair of a disability organisation .
Proudly , he told me that they had almost no one with Down syndrome in his city of over 10 million people , because they were not allowed to live .
This discrimination against persons with disabilities requires forthright dialogue , regardless of the economics between the EU and China .
On the issue of trade relations , in bringing pressure to bear on a government to improve its human rights , we must be willing to take decisive action , but careful that such actions do not make the situation of the poor in the country even worse .
Madam President , I find the report of Ms Valenciano Martínez-Orozco a comprehensive one , which clearly aims to strengthen and improve the European Union 's extensive action on human rights dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries .
Tonight we speak about one of the most important human rights instruments available to the European Union for promoting human rights in our relations with third countries .
I appreciate the critical but also constructive way in which the challenges that the functioning of human rights dialogues has to face with regard to the overall perspective and interinstitutional cooperation are addressed by the rapporteur .
I fully endorse most of the recommendations put forward by the report and the resolution .
I would especially like to draw your attention to the need to increase transparency and to adopt indicators for given benchmarks in order to achieve practical results that could be supported by other EU foreign policy tools .
I strongly support the recommendation to control the specific benchmarks for the EU-China dialogue on human rights as well as the EU-Russia consultations , hoping to develop them soon into a structured dialogue in order to assess the usefulness of human rights dialogues .
It is important also to apply and use the results of human rights dialogues in projects under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and systematically to link those two tools .
I fully support the recommendation that the role and involvement of the European Parliament in interparliamentary assemblies in human rights dialogues can , in the said countries , be enhanced in the future .
Last but not least , human rights must be the cornerstone of our political message , and it is crucially important to develop our message through consistency , transparency and the strong political commitment of all European institutions and the Member States .
Madam President , now that the eight-year long duel over the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor in Libya has ended , I feel we are badly in need of a sober assessment of the human rights situation in that country .
Ms Valenciano Martínez-Orozco 's report mentions the need to start a human rights dialogue with Libya .
I support the need for a dialogue within the Barcelona process .
However , let us be clear that we cannot forget or tolerate the fact that European citizens were abducted , tortured ( as was acknowledged even by Colonel Gaddafi 's son ) , kept in prison for eight years and subjected to a judicial process which was a farce , and then behave as if we should be grateful to , or reward , the Libyan side for letting them go in the end .
It has already vividly been reflected in the European media that this could turn into a case study for any dictatorship to focus attention and develop relations with the European Union .
Moreover , Libya started a campaign against the President of Bulgaria for having pardoned the nurses after they returned to Bulgaria , as if it expected that we would send them to prison straight from the airport .
On the basis of the European Commission agreement with Libya , Bulgaria had to underwrite USD 56 billion of Libyan debt for the Benghazi fund .
Other EU countries will spend even more .
However , once again , let us be clear that this humanitarian aid is being used politically by the Libyan regime to hide the truth and blame the West for a plot to deliberately infect Arab children .
This absurd accusation is still current .
Libya has not yet shown any intention of reform and we should not create the impression of applying double standards just because there is so much oil and gas in that country .
This is a test of the credibility of the European Union 's human rights standards .
Madam President , this excellent report by Ms Valenciano Martínez-Orozco brings together , in a comprehensive fashion , Parliament 's analysis of the potential , but also unfulfilled potential , of the EU human rights dialogue .
We demand action from the Council , sadly absent this evening .
The EU 's human rights strategy will never achieve optimum results without being organised in a systematic and coherent way , and without transparency and periodic review .
Of course our credibility on human rights depends on practising what we preach .
How can we urge countries like Jordan , Egypt , Libya , Morocco or Algeria to end torture , when we know that the United States subcontracted torture to them and that European countries colluded with that ?
Instead of being credible , we become hypocritical .
Our own House must be cleaned .
The silence of the Council , since our report in February on extraordinary rendition , does not go unnoticed .
One of the strongest dialogues we should be having is with like-minded countries , and I therefore welcome paragraphs 115 and 116 , which urge the EU to seek syllogies and share experiences while addressing human rights concerns with the US , Canada , Japan and New Zealand .
But , in the last six years , while concerns about the war on terror have been shared by most European citizens , we have had no robust action by the EU to secure transatlantic respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law .
Of course , I am not saying the US is the worst human rights defender in the world .
But it could be the model for human rights excellence and the tragedy is that the EU is not urging it in that direction .
The Council 's torture guidelines say the EU will make démarches and issue public statements urging relevant third countries to undertake effective measures against torture and ill-treatment .
What démarches ?
What public statements about abductions , torture , Guantánamo Bay ?
There is just embarrassed silence .
Perhaps an article in this week 's Economist magazine gives a clue .
Headlined ' Czechs with few mates ' , it explains how the Czech Republic , in its three years of EU membership , has earned a reputation for promoting human rights at every turn .
Great !
Right on !
Let us cheer !
However , reading on , I learn that inside the Brussels foreign policy machine , such concerns are an irritant .
EU diplomats apparently describe the Czech Republic as ' out on a limb ' , even ' unprofessional ' - no doubt the most disdainful insult in the diplomat 's armoury .
Silly young Czechs !
They believe the rhetoric about the EU being a human rights community .
They thought Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty , setting out our values of democracy , fundamental rights and the rule of law , were there actually to be acted upon !
But the old cynics in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or the Quai d 'Orsay will put them right .
I am on the side of the Czech Foreign Minister , Karel Schwarzenberg , who sees no contradiction between being a friend of America and a critic of its human rights breaches .
He opposes both the American trade embargo on Cuba and Guantánamo Bay .
' I am against Guantánamo because I think it is a violation of human rights ' , he says crisply .
( ES ) Madam President , I would like to refer to three aspects of this magnificent report .
Firstly , the role of Parliament in the democratic scrutiny of strategic documents relating to financial instruments on external assistance .
In the last plenary sitting we once again discussed and criticised the failure by the Commission to fulfil its commitment on transparency and parliamentary scrutiny in the context of the financing instrument for development cooperation .
I hope that this is not going to be repeated in this area .
Secondly , I would like the Commission to be asked to inform Parliament as soon as possible as to when and how it proposes to put in place the post-electoral protocol mechanism in the framework of Election Observation Missions , proposed by this report .
Thirdly and finally , the report calls on the Council and the Commission to analyse , support and coordinate the setting of benchmarks for EU dialogues with actions of other donors and international organisations , especially the UN mechanisms in place .
Tomorrow an urgent resolution will be debated in this House on the financing of the special court to judge war crimes in Sierra Leone , set up by the United Nations .
I consider this to be an example of the lack of coordination that currently exists between the EU and international organisations and a good example of the work that is still to be done .
I therefore hope that this report will be a step forward towards achieving this coordination .
( DE ) Madam President , today a group of Yezidi Kurds demonstrated outside this House , and I joined them , along with Mrs Uca and others .
This demonstration , by representatives of a group both dogged by terrorism and threatened with genocide , was another illustration of the incredible hope placed in this House with regard to human rights issues .
This is why it is important that our human rights work is carried out systematically and sustainably , and that it avoids making certain mistakes .
The first serious mistake is to make a distinction between large and small countries where human rights is concerned , coming down hard on small countries and yielding to large ones with whom we share important economic and strategic interests .
This is something that is done by many of our governments of all political orientations , but that this report avoids .
In particular , the report very bravely addresses the subjects of China and Russia , and I am obliged to Mrs Merkel for stating in very clear language on her latest visit to China and a visit some time ago to Russia that it is possible to both pursue interests and in spite of this , or because of it , to raise the subject of human rights in clear terms .
The second mistake we must not make is the following .
An Austrian writer , Gerd-Klaus Kaltenbrunner , once said that there are two types of oppressed community and individual victim : one with and one without sex appeal .
One is in the limelight for a while , and the other is ignored .
Human rights must apply to all , whether or not they are the focus of particular international attention at that time .
The third mistake we must avoid - and this too is vital - is introducing party politics into this issue .
That is why I regret the speech by Mr Meijer , whom I otherwise hold in high esteem .
Try asking Mr Kelam or Mr Landsbergis , who were under the threat of Soviet persecution , who it was who argued their case back then , in the 1980s : whether it was our group or Mr Meijer 's .
Imbalance and the tendency to abuse human rights for party political ends are found everywhere .
We should avoid this course in favour of that taken in Mrs Valenciano 's excellent report , and create a human rights policy that applies objective standards and crosses the group divide , and is worthy of the great human rights tradition of this House .
( ET ) I should like to thank the rapporteur for a good report and her high standard of teamwork .
I would like to highlight two points concerning our human rights dialogue with third countries .
In fact , I shall reiterate what the previous speaker said , but I believe it to be so important that it is worth repeating .
First of all , the point relating to conflicting interests and values , which is very important to me as well .
It is no secret that in the race to a globalised world we have sought to give preference to our own interests and values .
If we do not refer to and preach our own values then where our interests are pressing we will gradually forget them .
I welcome the rapporteur 's flexibility : we jointly presented proposals for amendments concerning Russia and Central Asia .
These are regions where interests often take precedence and our values have been left behind .
The European Union must remind its partners of the international arrangements and commitments entered into by them .
As a Council of Europe rapporteur , I certainly think that interests come first for large States , yet at the same time we are very eager to single small States out ; however , standards should be the same across the board .
Secondly , on a less important matter , I would like to refer to our conduct in relations with third countries and how this affects and supports human rights and related aims in host countries .
We must always provide hope , and not do the opposite , namely take hope away from them .
Each of the steps we take to tackle the sources of problems is observed with great care .
I believe , for example , that support from the West was important and necessary for the Balts , for their ambitions , and I find the effective absence of that support depressing .
In this regard too we should stress to our partners that they should comply with their obligations .
Finally , I repeat , this report covers those points and I thank the rapporteur once more for her high standard of teamwork .
( FI ) Madam President , first of all I want to thank the rapporteur , Elena Valenciano Martínez-Orozco , for her excellent and properly focused report .
It is very important for this European forum , the European Parliament , to deal with human rights .
I am in firm agreement with the rapporteur when she says that human rights should be at the core of the EU 's external policy .
When we talk of human rights , we have to remember that they should not be just the subject of mere rhetoric or just words used in political speeches and on special occasions .
They should be a commonplace reality both within the European Union and in our relations with other countries - third countries .
What do human rights in all their aspects represent exactly ?
The way I understand it is that human rights are the inalienable rights a human being has from birth to death , including the rights of unborn children and the elderly .
They include the rights of women , as has been said here , and the rights of children , but they also include the rights of the disabled , the sick , the elderly , everyone .
We have to remember that every life is precious and unique .
I would even say that every life is sacred , and nobody can take another person 's life - take away their human rights .
If we in the European Union could share with others the notion that human value and human rights always win out against market value , we would be on the right tack , on the right road .
Unfortunately , however , it would appear that we very often allow market value to supplant human rights .
China provides many examples of this , and these are very obvious to us today .
In addition , we now have the situation in Russia , for example , to take into account .
What are human rights in Russia ?
We see them ; we know of cases by name - Hodorovski and so on .
What have we achieved as a European community of values ?
Obviously , we in a European community of values and the European Union have to practise what we preach and defend human rights and human values everywhere , inside the Union , but also in our relations with third and developing countries .
( ES ) Madam President , in the second half of the twentieth century , and especially in the last three decades , democracy and respect for human rights have made enormous progress , but there is still a great deal to be done .
A few months ago in Berlin , in the Declaration adopted on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome , the EU institutions formally expressed their desire to promote freedom and democracy in the world .
In this policy we must work openly on the principle that respect for human rights affects the whole of the international community and that these rights are universal .
These two ideas are expressly mentioned in the final document adopted at the New York Summit in 2005 .
The theory that there are parts of the world which , for one reason or another , are exempt from observing human rights is not acceptable , in other words , the theory that there are regimes that cannot be required to respect freedoms .
I would like to recall here the brilliant essays by Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen on the global roots of democracy and democracy as a universal value .
In short , the promotion of human rights should play a very important role in the EU 's relations with all third countries .
One of the tools for this is dialogue , which is why I think it would be good to produce a report that helps to organise and systematise human rights dialogues that the European Union conducts with other countries .
I welcome the fact that paragraph 31 of the report calls on the Council to ensure that the initiation or suspension of a dialogue complies with clear criteria and for a prior impact assessment .
I also agree that dialogue should not be an end in itself .
I would like to end by briefly talking about Cuba , which is not mentioned in the report , and where , unfortunately , human rights and basic freedoms are still not respected .
However , the Council recently decided to propose initiating a comprehensive dialogue with Cuba that would include these rights .
It is well known that the position of the majority of Parliament is that it does not agree with the somewhat erratic policy that the Council has been following in the last three years with the Castro regime .
In our view , the priority before any other initiative , should be firm insistence on the freeing of political prisoners .
( PT ) Congratulations to my colleague , Mrs Valenciano , on her important report making concrete proposals to involve Parliament in the political dialogues on human rights held by the Council and the Commission .
That is not merely a question of trying to strengthen the EU as a global player at inter-institutional level .
It is a question of trying to reap the benefit of the added value which the European Parliament 's participation could bring to the substance of those dialogues and to the practical results they contribute to an area in which the insensitivity and diffidence of various European governments and bodies strikes an unfortunate contrast with the commitment and historic leadership of the European Parliament , the body representing the voice of the citizens of Europe .
It has to be admitted that there are many cases of inconsistency which detract from Europe 's credibility .
Only this morning in the debate on terrorism I criticised the European governments ' collaboration with the Bush Administration 's programme of trade in torture .
But , let us also consider European development policy , which is supposed to promote good governance and therefore human rights .
The current Portuguese Presidency is even aiming to strengthen European relations with Africa in this context .
Why do the Commission and the Council fail to make even the most basic use of the instruments already available to them , such as the Cotonou Agreement , which has specific articles on the subject of human rights ?
It is already clear today to 77 million Ethiopians and many more millions of Africans that the EU does not take the Cotonou Agreement seriously .
Thirty-eight elected members of parliament , journalists and activists imprisoned in Ethiopia following the 2005 elections , monitored by a European Union Mission , were released recently thanks to repeated pressure from this Parliament and in the face of an incomprehensible silence on the part of the Council .
Others , however , remain imprisoned , such as Netsanet Demissie and Daniel Bekele .
Will they ever be able to believe in the Cotonou Agreement and in the EU ?
Examples of failure to act or even nauseating grovelling on the part of EU representatives abound throughout the world - from Addis Ababa to Beijing , from Moscow to Riyadh and from Teheran to Havana .
Let us hope that the reports of a European Commissioner recently apologising to the Government of Sudan in order to avoid the expulsion of local Commission delegates prove unfounded .
( SV ) Madam President , in a world where democracy and human rights are not always evident - among our neighbours and sometimes in certain countries which , whilst not members of the EU , are still part of our Europe - the EU 's relations with the world around take on even greater importance .
Each such relationship , whether in the form of a meeting , a dialogue or an agreement , is an opportunity to assert our values and impose demands on countries which still do not live up to the meaning of the words humanity , human rights and democracy .
The report we are considering today is essentially good .
It illustrates some of the difficulties that arise when you deal with different wordings and approaches to human rights , but I still think that it should have been more critical as regards our attitude towards China or Russia , for example .
It is our duty to be critical of countries that do not respect human rights and that are not democratic , but it is absolutely essential that we criticise countries that believe themselves to be democracies - not only for the sake of our own credibility but also for all the people who live in those countries and who do not even have the opportunity to voice their criticisms .
Democracy and human rights in the EU are a given , so we sometimes think that they have always existed , they exist now and will always exist .
But we who were born in dictatorships know that we must fight for democracy and human rights every day .
It is not enough to say that human rights work is taking place and that things are improving .
There is also much to be done , as we so often say .
In our dialogues we must be much clearer and much more specific , both in our criticism and in our demands , and we must start to tell things as they are if we want to leave a better world for our children .
( FR ) Madam President , at this late hour , many things have already been said , but I would really like to thank Mrs Valenciano , of course , for this report .
It marks an important step in making European development policy more transparent and effective when it comes to human rights .
I am also taking the chance offered by this debate to call representatives of the Council and the Commission to better interinstitutional cooperation .
It is indeed essential to institute a dialogue between the Council , the Commission and Parliament so that action taken in the area of human rights can be better coordinated , and to prevent contradiction and duplication from interfering with the message to the outside world .
It is unfortunately an issue permanently in the news .
To take a specific example , that of Burma , our policy concerning the country is indecipherable from the outside .
The members of the EU have committed themselves to a common position in favour of national reconciliation , democracy and human rights , but in practice the EU Member States are divided , producing a weak and ineffective position that is having no effect on the regime in Burma .
Politically , the European Union has no clear strategy .
We concentrate only on humanitarian aid , which is obviously essential , but not enough .
We have not taken a position on how the UN Security Council should deal with the situation in Burma , offering no support for a resolution .
Moreover , the Commission has reduced the amount of subsidies for projects aimed at promoting human rights and democracy in Burma .
In short , the European Union has not used its influence positively and effectively to promote and support democracy and human rights in that country .
The recent failure of our call for the release of the Burmese Nobel prize winner , Aung San Suu Kyi , proves this .
Yet Parliament awarded her the Sakharov Prize in 1990 .
This example perfectly illustrates the fact that our three institutions must act together in presenting a coherent , intelligible policy for the defence of human rights .
( PT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report we are debating deserves our support in the first place because it examines in great breadth and detail a topic which is highly relevant for the European Union 's external dimension and I should like , therefore , to congratulate the rapporteur .
The worst thing that could happen for the European Union 's commitment to the global promotion of fundamental human rights would be for this to become an isolated question , dealt with separately .
The alternative , the right option I think , is to regard the promotion of human rights as both an ethical duty , for reasons which are self-evident , and as in the EU 's interest insofar as the instability , migratory flows and political and military tensions linked to human rights violations give rise to crises which make the world a more dangerous place .
I therefore agree with the fundamental question , but we ought to look into the question of the method .
If the EU were to maintain relations only with countries that respect human rights as we defend them , then our firm relations would extend to only a few countries .
Conversely , if the European Union were always to opt for the realism of economic , energy , geostrategic and other interests , it would soon discover that rather than defending immediate advantages it was actually creating greater dangers for the future .
What we must hope for is a coherent EU strategy which includes the tangible and quantifiable promotion of human rights on its foreign policy agenda .
It is not an option to allocate budgetary funds without evaluating the result of their application or to pay lip service to proposals which are never realised .
In this connection , the next EU-Africa Summit is an opportunity not to be missed .
If we wish to help Africa and the Africans - and we do - we must be generous and demanding in equal measure .
We do not , as I said , delude ourselves that we can only forge relations with countries which respect fundamental values , but we must maintain the conviction that the human rights agenda is part of our policy for relations with those countries .
Otherwise we should be yielding to the force of some dictator and giving a signal , not of our goodwill but of our lack of political capability and negotiating strength
A better world , Madam President , is a safer world and Europe cannot confuse the soft power of its diplomacy with dream power , or worse still , with no power at all .
( HU ) I warmly congratulate Mrs Valenciano on her excellent report ; she has put forward some very important proposals .
At the same time I would like to point out several gaps , which are not her fault but which represent conceptual shortcomings by the European Parliament and the European Union .
To take the example of China , we rightly protest against the violation of human rights or the restriction of freedom of religion but we never mention the 700 million people living in villages who have no social security and no pension .
I would ask : is this not an important human right ?
I would go further .
In the entire report there was not a single mention of the question of national minorities in China .
The European Union should now finally wake up to the fact that , whether in the Western Balkans or anywhere in the world , if it wants stability then it must be honest in its dealings with the issue of minorities , and national minorities .
The European Parliament needs to attend several seminars in the Council of Europe building to learn at last that human rights and minority rights are two completely different issues !
It is unacceptable that in the entire report there was no mention of the issue of national minorities , and no mention of the issue of migrant minorities or western European migrant minorities ; only today , in this very House , I have said that in France , Great Britain and the Netherlands the integration of new minorities is in crisis .
Thus if the European Parliament and the European Union do not change their approach , they will be incapable of managing international problems and international conflicts and will not have the moral high ground for judging China legitimately ; we should be putting our own house in order , with our own insoluble minorities issues , here in Europe .
Madam President , there has not been sufficient consistency in the EU dialogues with third countries and such a situation may undermine the very credibility of the EU 's human rights policy .
These are two conclusions of this report .
Therefore , our message to the Commission and the Council is very clear : human rights issues should be upgraded into practical policymaking .
In other words , they should not be conditioned by strategic or geopolitical interests .
The biggest challenge remains implementing these noble goals in our current relationships .
There is clearly a conflict of interest and views in the EU relations with the Kazakh dictatorship .
In the case of China and Russia , expressing the right concern about the situations there , we should also ask whether the dialogues as they have been conducted so far have produced a real improvement in the situation .
Also , speaking of Russia , that country should stop claiming that the EU-Russia partnership is founded on shared values .
In the present situation , it sounds rather ironic .
We need to call things as they are , as Putin 's Russia is probably where Hitler 's Germany was in the mid-1930s .
Not addressing these realities with all the power and authority of the EU makes us share responsibility for the brutal violation of human rights in Russia .
At the same time , Mr Schröder called on the EU not to burden Russia with exaggerated demands about human rights and democracy there .
Unfortunately , the fact is that the EU still lacks real grip while trying , with the best of intentions , to balance human rights and its economic and strategic interests .
( LT ) You can never give too much attention to human rights dialogue , and therefore I would like to welcome a speaker who has presented many suggestions and assessments .
The European Parliament wants to , and can , participate more actively in the Council and Commission dialogue with third countries on the issue of human rights because it has the necessary potential and experience .
The creativity and independence of MEPs can supplement the realism of the Commission and the Council .
We need to talk ever more loudly about the status of human rights defenders and the environment in which they work and also about economic , social and ecological human rights .
Although relations between the EU and the United States are overshadowed by the Iraq War and Guantanamo , they are healthy because of our common values .
The EU and Russia are linked by gas and oil pipelines , but human rights dialogue in Russia cannot be softened by energy sources and mercantile interests .
This large and important country is searching for a national idea and a special path .
Here I might mention a comment heard in Moscow : earlier we mistakenly thought that we were on the right path in Russia ; now we mistakenly think that we are on a special path .
Nobody argues against Russia 's right to travel down a specific path , if the majority of citizens want this .
It is another thing altogether if this is accompanied by restrictions on freedom of expression and of the press and NGO activity or exceptions for certain parties .
A human rights dialogue is not being sought with Belarus ; however , I believe that not only the human rights defenders in that country , but also the EU are interested in this .
The reason for which we actively criticise Belarus also applies to certain countries in Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus that even participate in the European Neighbourhood Policy .
However , greater losses and the smell of oil and gas should not soften attitudes towards the violation of human rights .
Madam President , I have to say that this was not an easy report to wade through .
It was excessively long and duplicative , but it deals with an important subject .
I am a staunch defender of genuine human rights .
But I must confess I have difficulty with the extension of the concept to cover just about every conceivable aspect of human activity : social , environmental , economic and cultural rights , to name but a few that are repeatedly referred to .
Nevertheless , the abuse of human rights throughout the world has never received as much attention as it does today , but paradoxically this has not led to change for the better in many countries where the worst abuses take place .
The EU has an important role to play in promoting the rule of law and respect for human rights , but its habit of flouting its own rules does nothing to encourage reform among the worst regimes .
In this regard I think especially of Zimbabwe and Burma , in relation to which the EU 's own travel ban and targeted sanctions have been ignored on spurious grounds on several occasions .
And we wonder why our measures are ineffective and tyrants laugh at us !
Many African countries have not responded to their obligations to deliver good governance .
It is not surprising if there is no strong message on this from EU interlocutors .
For years now we have tried to get other African countries to join with us in bringing about change for the better in Zimbabwe , but to no avail .
Meanwhile , that country plunges into economic chaos and millions of its people are left starving and destitute under Mugabe 's arrogant dictatorship .
It now seems there is a possibility that the EU will again break its own rules and invite Mugabe or other banned Zimbabwean ministers to the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon in December .
I wrote to the Prime Minister of Portugal about this on 3 July .
I have not yet received a reply .
As the Council is not here at the moment , perhaps the Presidency could find out what it intends to do on this subject ?
I hear from a report yesterday that Ms Ferrero-Waldner , the Commissioner for External Relations , has said that maybe they would invite the Foreign Minister instead of Mugabe !
Well , he is banned as well ; he is number 83 on the banned list .
So could we actually be told what is going to happen in this regard ?
( RO ) Mr President , dear colleagues , stating that woman 's rights are an integral part of human rights could be considered as a tautology because , they would be inherent .
Reality shows that they are only explicitly ignored .
We have recently inventoried the delays in attaining the Millenium Development Goals in which women are a target group but also essential factors for process acceleration .
In Elena Valenciano 's excellent report , the Commission and the Council are requested to consider the gender dimension in dialogue with partner countries .
However , in a dialogue there are at least two parties involved and we represent one of them .
We think that the efficiency of the measures to promote and defend woman 's rights as well as the control of their implementation also depend on the European parties , institutions and our governments ' sensitivity towards gender issues .
It is conditioned by the achievement of their own goals set out in the roadmap for gender equality .
We do not need to invent sophisticated indicators to observe that in the European Union there are governments where there is no woman or others that uncritically defend traditions and practices violating woman 's rights .
We all know that the decision to initiate a dialogue on human rights is taken based on several criteria laid down by the Council when certain situations are considered worrying in the partner country .
Even in the optimistic case that all the Council members are supporters of woman 's rights , I am wondering what kind of example we set for a country to which one requests measures on representation in political structures .
Unfortunately the remark is valid also for the European Parliament where there is a great reserve that the reform of our own structures include a balanced gender balance .
We request coherence between statements and acts from the European institutions and member states .
It is necessary to preserve coherence between Community policies and instruments so that they do not negatively interfere with the capability measures of women in partner countries .
Talking about women is important but letting them talk is even more important in order to improve the political climate , peace processes and to reduce corruption all over the world .
( PL ) Madam President , the report presented has my full approval , particularly as it relates to one of the most pressing problems facing not only the Union , but the world as a whole .
The quality of dialogue and consultation with third countries in the area of human rights depends primarily on coherence and transparency in action .
I would like to stress that the road to maximising the benefit of dialogue lies in tightening up cooperation , especially where the Union decision-making triangle is concerned .
We need to specify precisely the aims we are hoping to achieve .
The suggested increase in coherence should also extend to the common practice of separating human rights dialogue from other bilateral relations .
Admittedly the report does emphasise that hypocrisy of this kind should be eliminated in the case of China .
However , it is not sufficiently strongly worded as far as relations with Russia are concerned .
The criteria we apply to the subject of human rights should be clearly laid down for all countries , and most importantly they should be identical .
I am sorry to say that this rule is quite often broken .
Universally accepted standards are selectively applied , depending on the payback that can be achieved from this sort of action .
That is how the situation looks with regard to Russia , as I have said , with the European Union being Russia 's main trading partner .
Mutual benefits do undoubtedly flow from this fact .
However , we cannot allow the relativisation of human rights to come at the expense of good trading relations .
I hope I do not need to remind you that in the Russian Federation the use of torture and persecution against a racial background is widespread , as in Chechnya , while the organisation ' Reporters Without Borders ' places this country 147th in the world press freedom ranking , which is dangerously close to such countries as China and North Korea .
The consequence of which I am speaking also relates to Cuba , which , incidentally , is not mentioned in this report .
Like Russia , the European Union , as the main trading partner , appears to be closing its eyes to the things that go on there .
Despite the June resolution , no specific action has been taken .
We read from time to time that the European Parliament is demanding something or another , or deplores something , but do we think about what happens as a result ?
The Sakharov Prize has still not been awarded to the Women in White from Havana .
A further and highly significant element in the area of human rights is the need to sharpen up the instrument that governs the finding and distribution of financial aid to the opposition in countries with an inadequate level of democracy .
I would particularly like to emphasise how important it is to properly identify needs .
Opposition groups are often characterised by a weak level of formalisation .
We must do everything in our power to ensure that money reaches the right people , and not those in authority .
Please take it from me , I know this situation from my own personal experience , and for such people specific actions are of far greater value than resolutions and assurances .
I would like to take advantage of this discussion on human rights to draw your attention to the situation of Christians in Middle Eastern countries .
We are receiving alarming information about this .
In August two Christian activists from the Middle East Christian Association were arrested and accused of posting aggressive anti-Islamic messages .
In Algeria the government has restricted religious freedom for non-Muslims , and this has had a direct impact on Christians living in that country .
Repression by increasingly radical Muslims is also affecting Christians in such countries as Iraq , Egypt and Lebanon .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I appreciated the exchange of views on the report , which testify the commitment of Parliament to the cause of human rights .
Inspired by the debate , I would like to convey the Commission 's comments on the recommendations for increased transparency of the dialogue and involvement of the European Parliament and of civil society organisations in all aspects of dialogue and consultation - a point a number of interventions have referred to .
While some of the report 's recommendations are already becoming part of normal practice , such as those concerning briefings and debriefings , the three institutions should carefully consider the different suggestions and find solutions , while taking into account the EU legal framework and the arrangements between Parliament and the Commission , which are foreseen in the framework agreement of May 2005 .
In doing so , we should be pragmatic .
On one hand , this means not hiding behind regulations and ' business-as-usual ' excuses , and , on the other hand , carefully evaluating the political opportunity and the consequences of increased transparency on the effectiveness of the dialogue and the readiness of third countries to engage in the dialogue in the first place .
The impact on the actual dialogue and on relations with third countries should be carefully weighed , to avoid depriving the European Union of an effective instrument .
In all cases , I am confident that we will be able to find the appropriate arrangements to both satisfy the need for information and to preserve and increase the effectiveness of the instrument .
On the issue raised on including human rights in trade and sectoral agreements , the Commission considers that there is no need to replicate the human rights clause contained in the association agreement , partnership and cooperation agreement or sectoral agreements .
The absence of such a clause in sectoral agreements does not prevent us from carrying out human rights consultations with the country in question or to use any other of the instruments of the European Union human rights toolbox .
On the subject of cooperation programmes for democracy and human rights , the Commission would like to remind Parliament that the new instrument , the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights , foresees specific funds for projects in difficult countries such as Cuba and Burma / Myanmar , mentioned in this debate .
On the issue of the universality of human rights , let me emphasise that the European Union subscribes to the principle of the universality , indivisibility , interdependency and interrelation of all human rights .
According to this principle , proclaimed by the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna , human rights are dealt with globally in a fair and equal manner on the same footing and with the same emphasis .
Of course , this does not exclude the fact that , in a session , a particular set of rights receives more attention because of events on the ground or because of the readiness of our dialogue partners to address certain issues instead of others .
The Commission is particularly pleased to see that the report devotes several recommendations to women 's rights and to their inclusion in dialogues .
We should also not forget other sets of rights and groups that deserve attention .
On the question of electoral observer missions , the Commission agrees that political dialogue , and in particular human rights dialogue , offers the opportunity to plead with partner countries for the follow-up to EU electoral observer missions ' recommendations .
In that context , the Commission has also advocated the continuous engagement of the European Union Head of Missions .
This follow-up should focus on actions by the political and electoral authorities concerned and on an active role for civil society and democracy promotion , including electoral reform .
The Commission is not convinced of the need to put in place a specific and separate post-electoral protocol mechanism for that purpose .
The Commission takes the view that assistance , dialogue instruments and monitoring mechanisms exist , in order to ensure post-electoral strategies and democracy support , and these mechanisms should continue to be used .
With regard to the specific question by Mr Van Orden , I will convey his concern and question to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , who do doubt will provide you with an answer .
To conclude , let me state that I have taken note of the many other specific comments made on particular situations .
I assure you that such comments will be forwarded to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , who will certainly give them due consideration .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday 6 September 2007 .
Written Statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( IT ) I would like to give my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for her work , because I think it is of fundamental importance to adopt a consistent European policy on human rights and democracy when participating in international dialogue .
Too often , in fact , arguments based on economic and strategic interests have prevailed over the good intentions and European values declared in this Chamber .
With particular reference to economic and trade agreements with third countries or WTO negotiations , the EU sometimes pays insufficient attention to the rights of workers , minorities , women and children outside the EU , becoming a tacit accomplice in criminal atrocities and intolerable practices .
A European social , economic and energy policy that made the EU more independent in terms of human and energy resources would also help Europe to rid itself of certain geopolitical ties that in some situations compel it to keep silent on human rights .
Finally , many EP resolutions and declarations on particular situations often go unheard : it is important for both the Council and the Commission to pay more attention to calls by MEPs , who give a voice to requests by persons or ethnic groups otherwise excluded from any form of communication .
Among the many good things that are mentioned in this report , the fact that it calls on the Council and the Commission to involve Parliament more fully in preparing and following up dialogues with third countries is worthy of particular praise .
The European Parliament is , after all , an institution whose opinion on human rights matters is held in high regard throughout the world .
We should not forget , however , that dialogue with countries outside the Union must not become an end in itself .
It should be categorically emphasised that human rights cannot play a part in any negotiations or haggling with a diplomatic or economic basis .
Infractions of these rights cannot be tolerated , and the European Union , together with its agencies , must defend this principle absolutely in the light of the historical , cultural and moral values by which it is guided .
What we need to do essentially is to exert a constant and consistent influence on such countries as Russia or China , with which an institutionalised dialogue has already been in progress for some time .
It is essential to monitor the results of settlements and obligations agreed by them during successive rounds of consultations , as it is only in this way that real progress can be achieved .
In this context it is pleasing that the report mentions areas in which these countries still have much to do .
Sadly , though , there are still a great many problems like these .
Sustainability in EU fisheries through maximum sustainable yield ( debate )
The next item is the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the implementation of sustainable fishing in the EU on the basis of maximum sustainable yield .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Madam President , allow me to say , first of all , that today a Spanish fishing boat sank off the Andalusian coast and as a result three people died and five are currently missing .
I ask Parliament to stand with the families in their sorrow and the desire for the missing sailors to be rescued .
I will now move on to the report that we are discussing today .
The first thing that I would like to point out , as the Commission itself recognises and Parliament has stated on numerous occasions , is the clear failure of the Community fisheries management system , which over the many years it has been in existence has not ensured the sustainability of resources , and has done even less to support an efficient and profitable fisheries sector .
Paradoxically , the management system is the only one that was not a fundamental part of the major reforms of 2002 and , because of this , the Commission has to paper over the cracks here and there , dealing with unsustainable discards , inventing control measures day after day and establishing recovery plans , but without tackling the substantive issue : establishing a coherent and up to date framework for the fisheries management model .
This is the context in which we have received the Commission communication , which opts for maximum sustainable yield as the yardstick for long-term fishing activities , a theoretical model that seeks to combine the most efficient exploitation of a species with guaranteeing biological sustainability .
The problem is that maximum sustainable yield , which , as an intellectual and theoretical concept may be irreproachable , has been found to have more than a few contradictions in its practical application , and , in fact , a large proportion of the scientific community now considers it to have been largely superseded .
The issue is therefore one of redefining the model in such a way that it can be adapted to the reality of fishing communities , This is where a series of questions arise as to how to do this , which the report that we are presenting today has sought to highlight , and which are not in any way answered in the Commission communication , which is very ambiguous and vague .
It is clear that here we are not criticising the Commission 's intention to impose a new management model , but its inability to explain to us how it is going to overcome the difficulties of putting it into practice and avoid the pitfalls that exist in the actual formulation of maximum sustainable yield .
Among these , we know that maximum sustainable yield requires long series of reliable , accurate scientific data , while for the vast majority of species , it is not possible to have this degree of certainty .
Secondly , the model was created based on the exploitation of a single population , while the large majority of Community fisheries are multi-species , which means over- or under-fishing many of them , which is obviously contrary to the actual definition of maximum sustainable yield .
It also does not work for pelagic species , and we also now know that other factors influence the status of populations , such as errors in recruitment or environmental factors , which may result in incorrect definitions of maximum sustainable yield .
What is certain is that strict application of maximum sustainable yield will , in the short term , result in a sometimes drastic reduction in fishing opportunities , and therefore in the activity , income and employment of the Community fleet .
Madam President , allow me to thank all my colleagues for their contributions and to request the adoption of a report by means of which the Committee on Fisheries wishes to call on the European Commission first to clear up all these uncertainties before forcing the introduction of a type of model for some species of great economic importance whose effectiveness is , for many fisheries , scientifically and economically questionable .
The committee also wishes to call on the Commission to first seriously look at a clear fisheries management system , with an eco-system-based focus , and then to decide on how to adapt the reference points and the chosen model , whether this is based on MSY or something else .
This should not be done - and I must stress this point - without first carrying out a social and economic analysis of the repercussions of implementing it and measures to counter its impact .
All these questions are currently of great concern to our sectors and to us .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur , Ms Fraga Estévez , and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for a very thorough report on the implementation of sustainable fishing based on maximum sustainable yield ( MSY ) .
I am pleased to see that we are in broad agreement , in particular on the need to move away from annual decision-making allowing for a more gradual approach and for better planning by the sector .
A longer-term approach will also allow for more stability and sustainability in the exploitation of fisheries resources .
I am sure that we are in agreement on the objectives of urgently taking measures to improve the very poor state of fisheries resources in Europe in order to bring the stocks to sustainable levels , which , at the same time , will improve the profitability of the fishing industries in the long term .
Apart from the benefits to industry , there is an international political commitment that should be met .
In particular I appreciate and share the Committee on Fisheries ' view that the common fisheries policy needs a new management model for the setting of fishing opportunities , the recovery of depleted stocks and the adaptation of fishing effort levels to sustainable and profitable levels .
Also , and very importantly , adjusting fishing efforts to MSY levels is the single most important action that can be taken to reduce discarding in European waters .
I am aware that there are concerns too .
I share many of these concerns and know they will need to be addressed .
First of all , I know that evaluating MSY is not a simple matter .
There are scientific uncertainties and the matter is complicated because of eco-system effects and mixed fisheries issues .
Fisheries science is not yet able to predict accurately what MSY for any particular stock or mixture of stocks will be .
But we must not only look at the difficulties .
Science can tell us in which direction fisheries should move in order to improve yields and decrease costs .
Even if the destination is imprecise , the direction is known quite well .
We should start to move in the right direction and progressively evaluate and review the MSY reference points as fisheries develop .
Mixed fishery situations need to be studied carefully and the best possible solutions identified in relation to the potential yield of the whole fisheries system .
This progressive approach will allow environmental , economic and social aspects to be explored .
It is also the approach that has been adopted in the long-term plan for plaice and sole in the North Sea , which was adopted this year and which I consider to be a good model for the implementation of this approach .
As your report stresses , it is an urgent matter to start moving in the right direction .
Let me underline here that the long-term management plans in practical terms move fisheries management in the right direction : that is , away from over-exploitation and not necessarily to a fixed MSY target .
The plans include provisions for regular revisions of the targets that allow for the adaptation of MSY targets where necessary , for example , where there is a change in the natural environment or where there is a revision of the scientific advice .
Secondly , I agree that it is important to address fisheries issues on a local basis and to involve the stakeholders in the important decisions concerning the choice of objectives , the rate at which we should move towards those objectives and the right combination of measures to take such as tax , effort management and technical adaptations .
The Commission will only prepare MSY plans on a regional basis and only after a detailed consultation with the sectors involved .
The region advisory councils will play an important role here and their work has already begun .
Economic and social analyses are also important in this process and the Commission will accompany all proposals for management plans with impact assessments where economic , social and environmental aspects of the proposals will be analysed .
Increased support for fisheries research is a necessary part of the development of MSY plans .
The framework programmes , the work of the Scientific , Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries and the support of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea will all be important in this context , which will be a priority area for the next years .
Moving to MSY fisheries will , in many cases , mean adjustments of fleet capacity and reductions in fishing effort .
The European Fisheries Fund was designed so that Member States can plan the development of the national fleet capacity and use co-funding from the Community budget to help adjust the fleet size according to long-term objectives and taking appropriate social and economic provisions into account .
I would also like to say a few words in relation to the three amendments proposed by Mr Schlyter .
The Commission believes that a gradual approach to moving to MSY conditions should in fact be a general rule .
There is no need in all cases to move drastically to MSY .
As regards scientific methodology for reaching MSY , the Commission will ask for scientific advice on a case-by-case basis .
We should not prejudice the scientific debate by prejudging which methods may be better than others .
Lastly , as I have already stated , it is correct to say that the European Fisheries Fund provides for Member States to allocate public aid so as to restructure fishing fleets in line with MSY strategies .
This , however , should not be seen as compensation , because the fishing industry will be the eventual beneficiaries of the new policy but as a financial incentive to make the transition .
The Commission will continue the dialogue with the fisheries sector and will start to discuss specific long-term plans for a number of fisheries with an MSY perspective .
Implementing such plans will improve the stability and the productivity of stocks and of the industry .
I look forward to more discussions with you about these plans at a later date , after the Commission has developed impact assessments , consulted the industry and prepared our proposals .
There is a lot of work to be done and I will be very grateful for your support in developing this policy area .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President , I welcome Ms Fraga Estévez 's report , and particularly her highlighting of concerns on this proposal from the Commission , as I have serious reservations about the Commissioner 's proposals to adopt a maximum sustainable yield ( MSY ) model as the reference point for managing fish stocks .
The year 2015 is a political date , not a scientific one .
It is too early for some stocks and is too late for others in the context of overfishing .
While the proposal aims to maximise the economic yield of a fishery , and also maintain the capacity of the stock to produce maximum sustainable returns in the long-term , I fear that , far from reducing the levels of discarded catch , critical flaws in the model may cause over-exploitation , as the underlying assumptions used for calculating levels of catch are based on single-species , shallow-water fisheries and do not take account of geographic and biological diversity .
I applaud the objective of increasing efficiency in protecting fish species , as all of us must do .
But I believe that the Commission has not sufficiently researched this .
There has been no in-depth evaluation of the risks of error in the MSY model .
Moreover , for the large majority of scientists and also for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , the traditional MSY model has been superseded by new cutting-edge approaches which encompass the ecosystem as a whole , rather than relying on an outdated concept of animal population dynamics .
MSY is a blunt instrument , based on harvesting surplus production during high growth of population before it reaches carrying capacity .
But it is one which can lead to overfishing when applied to multi-species fisheries , as you cannot obtain optimum levels of all species at the same time , or when it is applied to pelagic species that dwell in deep seas and open water such as the North Sea and the Atlantic .
If adopted , this model will simultaneously result in the collapse of stocks and the collapse of the market .
I urge the Commissioner to take a sound , scientific and evidence-based approach .
Your own words , Commissioner , are that you should not prejudice the scientific debate .
I agree with you .
Take a scientific , evidence-based approach and re-examine this proposal rather than - with respect - just dance , albeit belatedly , to the tune of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Madam President , Commissioner , Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries , I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent work and also by congratulating the Commission for its communication which meets one of the requirements which it itself approved at the 2002 Johannesburg World Summit and also corresponds to the first of the eight objectives outlined at that conference .
The European Commission has certainly already accomplished a great deal within the scope of those eight objectives , but I would remind the Commissioner that we are in 2007 with objectives outlined for 2015 by a Summit which took place in 2002 .
The fact that we are still debating this communication at this stage does not seem to constitute a sufficiently rapid response to the scale of the challenges facing us .
I am delighted at what the Commissioner said with regard to the need for a new management model and , since the proposal places the emphasis on the concept of ecosystem management , I think we are well on the right track .
However , if we regard this concept of maximum sustainable yield as something radically new , we are mistaken , since that concept , which is a theoretical concept , was always the concept underlying the setting of all quotas and TACs , which could only be set on the basis of that concept .
This then is the challenge facing the Commission , which we hope will bring us some good news before long .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I regret that this is one of those occasions when I am delighted that Parliament has so few powers in this field , especially as there is a real possibility that this report might be carried in the vote tomorrow .
If so , it may well be that some people will say , ' well , Parliament has called on the Commission to look again at its proposals ' .
I would not like that public relations gesture to be made ; I want the Commission to know that there are at least some MEPs who thoroughly disagree with what is being proposed here .
The Commission 's report back in 2006 was weak - motherhood and apple pie stuff , frankly - and was hardly worth putting on paper .
There were plans , plans and plans being proposed but precious little by way of action .
However , what is being proposed here by the rapporteur - by Parliament - is , to my mind , even worse .
I look at one paragraph in particular : ' Considers that the time is not ripe to propose the introduction of a maximum sustainable yield [ MSY ] system ' .
Apparently , we need more analysis .
So , while the Commission wants plans , we simply want more talk about plans .
When is something going to get done ?
If this is carried tomorrow by Parliament , then I hope the Commission will disregard it entirely because I regard this as completely irresponsible .
There is a question , a legitimate question , about the methodology to be applied in achieving the status of MSY .
Frankly , we know what is needed ; this is just playing with words half the time .
If two thirds of the fish stocks are being fished beyond safe biological means , then you have to stop the fishing ; you have got to put the fleets on the side , you have got to put fishermen out of work , perhaps with compensation , until such time as we have restored the stocks and given everyone the chance of a long-term , healthy future .
You have got to allow the fish stocks to recover .
Frankly , we can debate the details of how we achieve perfection in MSY status when we have got the fish and the long-term security of having that fish firmly secured .
Commissioner , I have the highest respect for you ; ever since we first met , I have liked what you have said .
May I say two things ?
First of all , I think your profile is too low ; I think your cabinet keeps you in meetings in the back room .
I think Europe needs a champion for its fish and , just as you need to sort some problems out , you also need to be in front of Europe 's television cameras saying what needs to be done .
The second thing is this : you are three years , now , into a five-year term .
There have been lots of good ideas , not enough delivery .
I would like you to be a significant chapter in the European Union 's history over the deplorable common fisheries policy and its reform .
So please , stop thinking of yourself as a footnote and get out there and make things happen !
Five years ago , I was at Johannesburg , where the European Union signed up to the principle of securing maximum sustainable yield status by 2015 .
We were not talking about introducing a policy by 2015 ; we were talking about getting the fish up to those levels by 2015 .
It should not have been just a piece - it has to be more than that .
If we are to do that , in eight years , it will probably be already too late .
We have got to start having delivery , and , every day until that happens , you have to consider yourself a failure .
Do not listen to Parliament ; do not listen to the Ministers who try and block you all the time - just start delivering .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( SV ) Madam President , I can agree with much of what Mr Davies says .
Fish are dying !
When they die , there will be no income for fisherman .
So it is much smarter to invest in the future by having maximum sustainable yields now , rather than a maximum available yield , which has been the Union 's policy so far .
That is entirely unsustainable !
Then we can discuss scientific gaps in methods and the fact that it is perhaps a blunt instrument .
But the EU has low inflation as an overall target for economic policy and that is an extremely blunt instrument , but it has not been criticised in the same way .
In such cases this is a much sharper instrument and for that I want to thank the Commissioner .
You have realised that the policy is completely wrong , completely unsuccessful , and are now trying to put it right .
Later we will be discussing the problem of discards and a combination of measures may perhaps begin to resolve the problems .
But when we talk about socioeconomic assessments , we must have a longer time perspective .
That is the thrust of my amendment .
Without it , you might as well say , ' Oh well , fishermen today do not want to do anything ! '
To take away the jobs of the fishermen of all future generations , that is , if anything , a poor socioeconomic assessment .
As a general comment on the fundamental points contained in the report under discussion , which is of crucial importance for the fisheries sector , we think it is relevant to point out the differences in the long- and short-term application of the principle of sustainability in fisheries .
That is , the long-term plans aim to define objectives or themes to achieve a stable situation to be reached after a relatively long period , whereas short-term measures are based on proposals drawn up annually in order to rectify , in a short period of time , the fishing mortality rate until the level proposed as a long-term objective is reached .
As regards the long-term objective for fisheries the principal objective laid down in Johannesburg might be accepted - that of obtaining the maximum sustainable catch of fish stocks .
However , it is important to stress that , in order to formulate the maximum sustainable yield objective , it is essential to apply scientific analysis to determine the fishing mortality rate that guarantees the maximum catch which the fisheries resources can provide in a sustainable manner .
For that it is essential to take account of the natural characteristics of each fisheries resource , as well as to know the nature and type of fishing methods .
To assess the fishing level that is appropriate for the long-term objective , it is necessary to check the forecasts drawn up by scientists , which implies that these forecasts must be based on reliable information , that they will be adopted by managers and accepted and obeyed by fishermen , always safeguarding , and I want to stress the always , the socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector and of the fishing communities .
In practice , the aim is to estimate the long-term catches and the corresponding fishing mortality rates .
For that we need to select a criterion for sustainability and determine the level of fishing that produces the maximum sustainable catch level .
This is where the real debate begins .
Different values have been proposed for fishing mortality rates for the long-term management of stocks in the Member States ' exclusive economic zones .
Various scientists think it is preferable to set F0.1 as the fishing mortality rate rather than , for example , FMSY , which they regard as less appropriate .
It should be noted that FMSY , which is the fishing mortality rate , should not be confused with MSY , which is the catch level .
Finally , I agree that it is essential for the sustainability measures to be accompanied by an evaluation of the socio-economic consequences and costs entailed in implementing them .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , it is not often that a member of the UK Independence Party congratulates a rapporteur in this House .
In this case I will make a rare exception .
The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has estimated that the catch of 70 % of fish species on this planet has already reached or exceeded maximum sustainable yield ( MSY ) .
The common fisheries policy , with the disgraceful problem of discards that results from it , has made a major contribution to what is potentially a grave ecological disaster , especially in the North Sea .
In the 1980s , the Canadian Government was warned by fishermen that cod was being dangerously overfished .
The Government ignored the warnings and , by 1992 , the cod fishery totally collapsed .
A similar situation now seems to be evolving in European waters .
The rapporteur refers to deficient analysis and inadequate solutions offered by the Commission 's communication , which she goes on to describe as simplistic .
The Commission has recently been criticised for the way it gathers and interprets statistics on maritime issues .
In a recent briefing , the British Government refers to ' an absence of necessary data on what the appropriate targets should be ' .
The Commission 's interpretation of MSY is based on outdated models and dogmatic ecological concepts .
It clearly demonstrates the desire to gain further competences at any cost .
The loss of our fishing stocks is too high a price to pay , and I thank the rapporteur for being honest in her condemnation of the Commission 's communication .
It surely says something when the Europhile PPE-DE Group is echoing the UKIP line .
But then , everyone gets there sooner or later !
Madam President , Commissioner , the reports by our two colleagues , including the one by Mrs Fraga , relate to this insoluble problem of fisheries - insoluble because fish stocks are limited and demand is constantly increasing .
Consequently , the fisheries policy is not the CAP .
Since 1968 and Sicco Mansholt , the Commission has for 40 years been making a strategic mistake with the CAP , which amounts to a crime against humanity : humanity needs cereals and milk and they are in short supply as the increase in prices shows .
With fisheries policy it is different .
The Commission 's mistakes simply come from its normal , technocratic sin , but not from a strategic crime .
Management of fish stocks with TACs , quotas , FIFGs and MAGPs has failed .
The Commission has legislated on everything : nets , tonnages , fleet power , number of units and when all is said and done - as the rapporteur tells us - there are fewer fishermen , less cod and even less bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean , hence the fury of fishermen in June and July .
Where I come from , for example , in the port of Sète or Le Grau-du-Roi , the fishermen who use thonaille fishing , which is traditional coastal fishing with small nets , were protesting that they could not fish from July onwards .
Nevertheless , despite all these checks , all this destruction , all these sanctions - perhaps one day they will even put electronic tags on fishermen to monitor them - the stocks are in danger , the rapporteur tells us .
The Common Fisheries Policy has not worked , and why ?
Because the problem is worldwide : China , Indonesia , the Philippines and Peru fish .
As with wine , where we are pulling up as the rest of the world is planting , we are breaking up our boats as the United States are building more of them and as Russia , Iceland and Norway are increasing the engine size of their vessels .
You can invent indicators , a type of maximum sustainable yield , but if your neighbour is fishing more , you fishing less will not improve stocks .
Moreover , because farming , or aquaculture , is not a real solution either because of fishmeal , fisheries is therefore the perfect demonstration that the Community level is both too high when the fishing is coastal and the decision should be local , or too low when the fishing is deep-sea .
In these cases , either we will very quickly rise to global level with the help of scientists , or by the end of the twenty-first century , we will be going to the cinema to fish for the last Nemos .
Madam President , I welcome and support this report and commend the rapporteur on its production .
We have had years of talk about sustainable fisheries , and as many years of bureaucratic controls .
Yet stocks in the main are no better , and fishermen are a lot fewer and a lot poorer .
It is hard to escape the conclusion that fisheries policy to date has indeed been a hopeless failure .
Fishermen have been saying this for years , but until now the Commission has not been listening - nor , it seems , has Mr Davies , who seems to want more of the same failure .
Total allowable catches ( TACs ) and quotas as the key instrument of control have been a disaster , generating the scandal of discards and , for many fishermen , nothing short of poverty .
Yet within the new proffered maximum sustainable yield model , we still have this flawed overlapping of the TAC quota system with the fishing effort system .
They must be disentangled .
We cannot have both .
We all want sustainable fisheries , but that means sustainability for fishermen too .
It means discouraging discards .
It means simplifying the technical measures , and it means embracing flexibility .
Let us get there as quickly as possible .
I think , therefore , Commissioner , that one of the main problems that this Communication raises is that , as it seeks to take action on resources , only restricting fishing activity without placing obligations on the other economic players with activities associated with the marine ecosystem , it loses , and we all lose , political legitimacy , especially as the Commission Directorate responsible for fisheries is also responsible for maritime affairs .
My second concern or question is how the Commission intends to apply MSY from a practical point of view , as all the indications are that it raises problems , serious problems , especially in the case of mixed fisheries in which different species interact and the level of catch that determines the level of effort does not correspond to the MSY of each individual species .
Another problem that we also have is with those populations for which we do not have any sort of assessment .
What is certain is that those working in the sector are concerned and they are right when they say that gaps left by the Community fleet in order to respond to MSY , to this political commitment to MSY , will be immediately filled by undertakings from third countries , as the fisheries market is controlled by the need to provide a continuous supply .
Madam President , over the years I have not always agreed with our rapporteur , Ms Fraga Estévez , but much of this report I can agree with .
It says the Community system has made controls difficult and encouraged discards .
It says it welcomes the Commission 's communication recognising that the existing fisheries management policy has failed .
It notes that it will be difficult to apply the maximum sustainable yield model to multi-species fisheries , which certainly applies to most that Scots fishermen are involved in .
It notes that the model is unsuitable for pelagic species .
I disagree with the words ' eliminated discrimination ' and will be asking for a split vote tomorrow to take these out , because I know from past discussions with our rapporteur that this is code for an attack on relative stability which , for as long as we have a common fisheries policy , must remain .
But I agree also with the Commissioner 's comments earlier when he said that we must start to move in the right direction .
After all the years of pain that has been inflicted directly as a result of the common fisheries policy , we should have been rather further forward by now .
( PL ) Madam President , with just one minute to speak , I have been asked to take the floor on behalf of Polish fishermen , who wish to state that the regulation that has been introduced concerning a ban on cod fishing discriminates against Polish fishermen , especially in view of the widespread knowledge concerning other countries ' catches .
The fishermen hope that the wording of the regulation has arisen out of ignorance on the part of the European Commission with regard to the true scale of fishing in the Baltic Sea by individual countries .
They demand not only that the regulation be rescinded , but also that a special independent commission be appointed under the auspices of the European Parliament to investigate and explain the principles and method of counting fish numbers in the Baltic Sea following enlargement of the Union in 2004 , and to grasp the extent of the irregularities .
Madam President , few of us will dispute the importance of having long-term sustainability of commercial fish stocks .
The EU signed up to the commitment made by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 to reach maximum sustainable yield ( MSY ) in fisheries by 2015 at the latest .
It is vital that we open up the debate on how to achieve the goal of reducing fishing pressure on vulnerable species , and this report by Ms Fraga Estévez is an important part of that process .
The merits of fishing at low levels of fishing mortality and building up a more robust spawning stock were also considered in the Net Benefits Report by the UK Prime Minister 's strategy unit .
As a Scot I am all too familiar with the pressures on vulnerable fishing stocks such as North Sea cod , and all the more with the practical difficulties of applying management plans in mixed fisheries areas such as off the Scottish coasts .
The difficulties do not remove the obligation to act .
I welcome the recognition by the Commission of the need for stakeholder involvement and that regional advisory councils ( RACs ) are included in the proposed process for taking this forward .
Some of the RACs have already begun to consider long-term management and the issue of MSY , and it will be important that the strategy is developed in partnership with stakeholders .
At this stage we should not get too side-tracked by discussing the technicalities of what MSY actually is and how it should be applied .
A more important focus is bringing fishing opportunities into better balance with available stocks for a more sustainable future .
( ET ) Ladies and gentlemen , five years ago , at the sustainable development summit in Johannesburg , we entered into a commitment to conserve fish stocks and restore them rapidly to the level which ensures maximum sustainable yield .
The change to the administrative system which is being planned sets considerably more ambitious objectives as compared to the current safe level and the precautionary principle .
However , the pros and cons of the change must be weighed up very carefully .
The European Union needs a flexible system to manage fish stocks and the facilities to react quickly .
There also needs to be provision in the long-term plans for reasonable yet flexible yearly adjustments .
The European Commission assumes that fish stocks are affected primarily by catches , although the weather , predators , foreign species and man-made problems can have major impacts on stocks .
The impact of the gas pipeline between Russia and Germany on the environment of the Baltic Sea has not yet been assessed , although construction is already under way .
It is a source of great concern to me that the comb jellyfish has recently been sighted in the Baltic Sea , as the species , which originates in America , led to the near collapse of fish stocks in the Black Sea in the 1980s and it is now wreaking destruction in the Caspian Sea .
In one year it has spread from the coast of Sweden to the heart of the Baltic Sea .
We must not twiddle our thumbs until the fish stocks in the Baltic Sea have been destroyed as well .
The effects of the new administrative system therefore need to be explored primarily at regional rather than European level , because every Member State 's fishing fleet has its own distinctive features .
It is extremely important to involve regional advisory bodies if we are to implement a forward-looking fisheries policy .
The change to the administrative system requires a reduction in fishing fleet numbers and in their loads and therefore means large losses for our fisheries undertakings .
The European Fisheries Fund plainly does not have sufficient means to deal with such large losses .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , first of all let me refer to the accident that Ms Fraga Estévez and Ms Miguélez Ramos mentioned .
I share their concern and sorrow at the loss of life and hope that the missing fishermen can be brought to safety .
Allow me to pick up on some of the points that were raised in the debate , which have proved to be quite varied to say the least - poles apart on how to move forward .
However , having said that , from the debate it is clear that we share a common view that fisheries have to be brought to sustainable levels as soon as possible .
This does not mean that what we are proposing is drastic and immediate action .
Rather we are setting ourselves an objective to arrive at maximum sustainable yield ( MSY ) in a gradual and flexible manner .
At each step we will re-evaluate and re-assess the targets we set and if required , we will adapt them to changing situations .
In other word , the MSY approach is providing us with a direction and not necessarily with a fixed target .
Let me repeat , the MSY approach moves fisheries management in the right direction , away from over-exploitation and towards conditions of higher and more stable catches and lower costs .
This approach should be adaptive so that as we learn more - or , as environmental and ecosystem conditions change - new knowledge can be applied to the approach .
The point has been raised that MSY has not worked and is not appropriate for pelagic stocks , and that it is an outdated concept .
Let me say there have been fisheries management strategies in Europe and in other parts of the world which were successful .
Although the concept is not new , it does not mean that it is outdated .
The important point is that , as long as it defines a path for fisheries management and is flexible enough to allow for regular revisions , it has good chances of success .
Good examples of some success can be seen in stocks such as saithe , North Sea haddock and mackerel , which are fished close to MSY level and which are generally stable and profitable .
Let me highlight one point . The purpose of this proposal is not to penalise fishermen , who , admittedly , have to make a number of adjustments , but rather it seeks to reach an objective and embark on a direction where the sector operates in a more stable and in a more profitable environment .
As I stated in my opening statement , the European Fisheries Fund allows Member States to develop measures concerning adjustments of capacity and fishing effort in the context of long-term plans , including social and economic provisions involving the appropriate use of public money , in their operational programmes .
Another point raised relates to the fact that MSY will not work in mixed fisheries , because when targeting one stock to move towards MSY one could end up in a situation where the other stocks caught in such a mixed fishery are under-exploited .
I think we have to be realistic about the situation and the majority of mixed fisheries .
The stocks concerned are equally exploited to unsustainable levels .
It is clear that the application of the MSY approach to mixed fisheries will be difficult and will have to be studied on a case-by-case basis .
However , the mixed fisheries problem exists and , if we do not address it , there can be no improvements and no steps can be taken in the right direction .
Regarding consultation , let me say that the Commission is committed to stakeholder involvement and consultation .
Many consultations have already been held since the adoption of the objective of MSY at the Johannesburg Summit .
Such consultations involved Member States , scientists and the regional advisory councils , who are studying our proposal as well and who are seeking to advise us on the best way forward .
Discussions on the plans will be held at a later stage , after we have developed impact assessments , consulted the industry and drawn up our specific proposals .
I look forward to a continued dialogue with you on these plans .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday 6 September 2007 .

( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe has lost one of its greatest artists today .
Luciano Pavarotti died this morning in Modena , and I think it only right to pay tribute to this great man of art and culture who took European music to the entire world .
His passing is a huge loss to the European Union as a whole , and I believe it fitting to remember Luciano Pavarotti in this House .
Review of the consumer acquis ( debate )
The next item is the report by Mrs Patrie , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on the Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis .
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Madam Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Kuneva for our productive exchanges .
Why do we have this Green Paper and EP report ?
Three factors justify this exercise aimed at making the European consumer acquis , i.e. eight Directives adopted between 1985 and 1999 , more consistent and more modern .
First of all , the rapid development of new marketing techniques , primarily e-commerce , has rendered some of the European laws obsolete .
Secondly , there are many inconsistencies in the current acquis , which contains different legal definitions of identical concepts .
Thirdly , the decision made in the past to opt for minimum harmonisation , thereby allowing the Member States to retain specific national provisions , has resulted in fragmentation of the legal environment , given that the rules in force lay down a minimum European standard but do not define a single method for meeting it .
The consequence of this , according to the September 2006 Eurobarometer , is that 50 % of citizens are more wary of cross-border purchases while 71 % believe that it is more difficult to assert their rights when buying from sellers based in another Member State .
Similarly , it is important for economic operators in that they will benefit from a secure regulatory environment and will be able to make the most of an internal market comprising nearly 500 million consumers .
One of the challenges of this review is enter a qualitative stage , to some extent laying the foundations for a European consumer code .
However , what method should be used ?
The European Parliament fully supports the methodology proposed by the Commission , namely a mixed or combined approach : on the one hand , it is based on the definition of a horizontal instrument to ensure maximum harmonisation , applying identical legal concepts across the current Directives ; on the other hand , it provides for the revision , where necessary , of some of the sectoral Directives , where minimum harmonisation will continue to apply .
The horizontal instrument must be formulated with a view to bringing together the basic rights of European consumers .
First of all , it will contain a single definition of ' consumer ' , which in Parliament 's view should apply to any natural or legal person acting for purposes which are outside their trade , business or profession , while a ' professional ' should be defined as any person acting for purposes relating to their trade , business or profession .
You may ask why such a restrictive definition of ' consumer ' is necessary ?
In fact , it is in the interest of consumers themselves .
There is a high risk that extending the specific protection offered by consumer law to a broader range of beneficiaries would result in a lower level of protection , which we want to avoid .
Secondly , the horizontal instrument will guarantee consumers ' right of withdrawal in the case of purchases made on the Internet or in a doorstep situation .
The arrangements for calculating the period of withdrawal will be harmonised : at the moment the withdrawal period is , for example , a minimum of seven days for distance contracts , but in certain countries , such as Germany and Finland , a 14-day period has been introduced .
The methods of exercising the right of withdrawal will also be harmonised .
Thirdly , the horizontal instrument will clarify what is meant by ' unfair terms ' in contracts between professionals and consumers . There will be a black list of banned terms , a grey list of terms presumed to be unfair and other terms which consumers could demonstrate to be unfair by means of legal action .
Fourthly , the duration of the two-year statutory guarantee will be extended to include the period when the goods are out of use for repair .
Fifthly , the right to remedies will be reaffirmed and its arrangements clarified ; above all , the horizontal instrument will be able to adapt to change .
Specific legal questions will continue to be dealt with in the so-called sectoral Directives and will for the most part be subject to minimum harmonisation , with , in our view , a mutual recognition clause , whose mechanism will have to be defined and which should facilitate the resolution of any legal conflicts .
Finally , my report stresses that without information , and without being able to invoke these remedies , consumers have nothing but virtual rights .
Effective application of their rights requires national and European information campaigns , greater visibility and a more active role for the European Consumer Centres , and the facilitation of judicial and extrajudicial remedies .
In conclusion , Parliament recalls the discussion on collective redress .
As rapporteur , I believe that collective redress , as a specific means of resolving mass disputes , is an important method that warrants further consideration .
I call on the Commission to submit precise studies and legal proposals in the next few months .
However , I must state clearly that the European form of collective redress will be different from American class actions , whose very proactive philosophy involving the aggressive canvassing of consumers by unscrupulous lawyers , and methods that provide , in particular , for the award of punitive damages borne by the operators , are completely alien to the judicial culture of European countries .
On the contrary , I believe that a European procedure will have to allow associations to act on behalf of all those who have suffered similar losses caused by the same dishonest professional to obtain , through a single process and without any express action on their part , the compensation they are owed .
To conclude , I would like to say that this Green Paper defends ambitious goals and I personally hope that Parliament 's vote clearly indicates the way forward for the Europe of consumers .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am really very pleased to be here today to discuss with you the very important issues raised in the Green Paper on the review of the consumer acquis .
I should like to start by thanking most sincerely Ms Patrie , all the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and Mrs Wallis , who gave the opinion for the Committee on Legal Affairs .
It was excellent teamwork , with very close cooperation on this ambitious report .
I am not just being courteous : it is sincere recognition of Parliament 's hard work .
The eight consumer protection directives under review focus on the contractual stage of the processes of sales or services provision .
The eight directives in place deal , for instance , with consumer sales , distance contracts , doorstep-selling and unfair contract terms .
However , they are all based on minimum harmonisation , leaving us with a patchwork of national rules built on top of the Community 's standards .
This regulatory fragmentation is confusing for consumers and costly for businesses .
That is why , on 8 February 2007 , the Commission began a major consultation - a Green Paper on the review of the consumer acquis .
The aim of the review is to simplify and adapt the existing rules by reducing regulatory fragmentation .
This should , ultimately , improve consumer confidence in the internal market and allow businesses , in particular small and medium-sized enterprises , to trade more easily across the EU .
Through this process , we have the opportunity to contribute to a truly integrated EU retail market , providing consumers with lower prices and more choice and giving a measured stimulus to growth and jobs .
I am glad that the Commission and the European Parliament agree on a common line in approaching this very important and challenging issue .
Your support will be an important reference for our follow-up work and for specific proposals .
After the European Parliament has adopted its report on the Green Paper , the outcome of the consultation will be published on the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-General website .
This will take place in October .
However , I can already give you an outline of the results on some key issues .
First of all , the Commission welcomes Parliament 's support for a mixed approach to the review , consisting of a combination of horizontal instrument-regulating aspects which some different directives have in common , and maintaining specific aspects in sectoral directives .
I can already inform you that this mixed approach is supported by a large majority of respondents to the Green Paper .
As regards harmonisation , the Commission welcomes Parliament 's endorsement of the principle of targeted full harmonisation , that is to say , full harmonisation of key aspects of consumer protection directives , which are needed in order to achieve the internal market for businesses and for consumers .
This support for full harmonisation across the consumer acquis - or targeted full harmonisation - is shared by the majority of respondents to the Green Paper , in particular by businesses and Member States .
Nevertheless , minimum rules will remain in several areas .
The Commission agrees with Parliament that the mutual recognition clause should apply in these areas in order to make sure that additional requirements imposed by Member States do not create unjustified internal market barriers .
On more specific issues , such as harmonisation of withdrawal rights across the acquis , the definition of delivery of goods or the drawing up of a combined grey and black list of unfair contract terms at EU level , the majority of respondents to the Green Paper have expressed views which are largely in line with the report to be voted on today .
In conclusion , I would like to thank you for your commitment to helping European citizens to enjoy all the benefits of the internal market .
I look forward to working with you to fulfil our common goals and to achieve a citizens ' internal market .
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs . - Mr President , I would like to start , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , by thanking Ms Patrie for her cooperation and work together on this report .
Clearly , the Committee on Legal Affairs welcomes very much the Green Paper and is grateful that the Commission has waited for Parliament 's opinion .
The word that runs through my committee 's opinion is coherence , and the need for coherence .
We see this very much as part of the ' better law-making ' agenda , which was discussed in this House earlier this week , but also as coherence across internal market legislation and across into the whole area of civil and commercial law , and contract law is very much part and parcel of that .
I would have to start by saying that there are some of us who , in dealing with this matter in the Legal Affairs Committee , have perhaps begun to regret the passing of what , in the previous legislative term , was our joint Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
It is good that consumer affairs are now dealt with by the same committee , but it is perhaps a shame that we have lost that focus on the internal market and civil and commercial law .
That clear focus has been somewhat fractured .
In the past , we , as a Parliament , have been very quick to condemn the Commission for a lack of joined-up thinking , and we must not ourselves now be guilty of the same difficulty .
That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs is so clear that in dealing with this review we must keep an eye on the wider context of contract law and civil and commercial law as a whole .
In that respect , I must of course refer to the work on the common frame of reference to do with contract law .
Much work has been done on that in the past and our committee hopes that much work will continue to be done on it in the future .
That is absolutely essential to the opinion that we have delivered .
The contract law project is at the heart of better law-making , and arguably this review of the acquis should be the jewel in that crown .
They are inextricably entwined and , even if the Member States are reticent about the whole of the contract law project , this Parliament is not and will not be in the future , and looks to the Commission to pursue that work together .
Of course , with consumer law , it is very difficult .
We have all said that we want more harmonisation , and that seems to be the general tenor of the responses received .
But consumer law needs to be very much accessible and understandable to our citizens for our internal market to work .
Both sides of the bargain need to understand their rights and obligations .
In a national context , consumer law has grown up over the years , perhaps sometimes as a result of experiences at national level - often bad experiences , unfortunately - and also within a certain cultural context .
That means that the consumer law that we all know in our national environment is a law that has some resonance between us and our citizens .
It is accepted .
People know what it is about .
But how do we get that same resonance , that same understanding , that same accessibility at European level ?
That is what we have got to strive to achieve in any horizontal instrument if we are to give consumers across the internal market the confidence that they obviously currently still lack in order to use the internal market much more .
Now , it is also clear from what I have said that we are concerned , as a committee , that we make sure that the consumer acquis works together with other European law instruments , specifically private international law instruments like Rome I.
We cannot go on for ever having this battle about whose law shall apply .
We need , therefore , to have the contract law project , the common frame of reference .
We need a horizontal instrument , and we need to aspire to what some have called the ' blue flag ' giving us European terms and conditions of trade and European consumer and contract provisions that will really make our internal market work .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to start by thanking Mrs Patrie for her good cooperation and work on this report .
From our perspective , I believe we could have fully supported the outcome of the committee 's work .
Consumer protection is extremely important , especially to the PPE-DE Group .
I have three minutes , so let me say a few key words : first of all , it is absolutely right , as Mrs Wallis has also just said , that there is a need to review the joined-up thinking - the coherence - of the various Directives as part of the ' better law-making ' agenda , and to some extent to consolidate the common elements with a view to a systematic review .
In this context , however , we do not want to see any expansion towards a consumer contract law , and the efforts must also be coordinated very closely with the work on the common frame of reference ( CFR ) , which must be taken into consideration .
What is also important , from our perspective , is absolute coherence with the provisions of Rome I , i.e. the applicable provisions in private international law .
As regards the individual Directives , I broadly endorse the minimum harmonisation approach - and what Mrs Patrie has said - but this does not exclude the possibility that individual areas should be conclusively regulated where possible .
However , a cautious approach should be adopted here , taking account of the cultural characteristics and circumstances in the individual Member States ; otherwise , overregulation will be the result .
I would just like to draw attention to Amendment 4 tabled by the Socialist Group , which states that in the framework of harmonisation no regulatory provision may be abolished in a Member State .
This would mean that if harmonisation takes place - in other words , if everything is added together at the end - then the outcome will be the opposite of what you , Commissioner , have quite rightly called for , namely clear and simple legislation that works for everyone .
Instead , the outcome could be overregulation , and that is not what we want .
More generally , the Commission has raised a number of sometimes very serious questions about the individual Directives , which require very careful review and to which we have responded individually .
In particular , we reject class actions : we do not want US conditions in Europe .
We also reject producers ' liability or the restriction of freedom of contract if individually negotiated clauses or the price is to be reviewed in the framework of the standard terms and conditions of business and the abuse clauses .
I just want to point out that an integrated approach is crucial .
Consumers are not only consumers ; they are also entrepreneurs , company employees - could I just ask how much time I have left , I was not listening before : I thought I had three minutes , so I am being quite quick - and they also have an interest in the welfare of their companies .
A holistic view is therefore essential .
I am sure the Commission takes the same view .
We cannot only ever look at this issue from one perspective .
Consumers are not well-served if they are presented with comprehensive legislation that ultimately destroys the opportunities for the economy and their own businesses .
On that note , I would like to reiterate my thanks to everyone involved in the deliberations on this issue .
I am very grateful for that .
What does the approach taken here mean ?
The task , after all , is to do something for consumers , and to make the law simpler , clearer and more comprehensible .
This is the objective we want to pursue , so this mixed approach is precisely the right one .
Horizontal aspects , full harmonisation where possible , for example as regards the definition of the consumer or the definition of business , is what this is about , but it is also about implementing the European Union 's Treaties , which allow the Member States to retain or introduce a higher standard of law , if they consider it right to do so .
This law must naturally be respected .
On the issue of mutual recognition , this means confidence among citizens and it means consumer confidence .
That is what this is about , and that is what we need to develop .
I fully endorse what Mrs Wallis has said : we must ensure that private international law , as defined in Rome I , for example , is also respected .
Otherwise , we will again have this patchwork which leads to a lack of clarity and to legal uncertainty , which is not what we want .
For that reason , my group says a resounding ' no ' to this bizarre internal market clause which is constantly being upheld by some Members of this House .
None of them has so far been able to explain to me what they are actually trying to achieve .
However , I suspect that what is behind it is an attempt to call the provisions of Rome I into question once more .
We say a resounding ' no ' to that ; that is why we do not want this provision .
As regards class actions , Mr Lechner , it really is becoming quite ridiculous when I hear you say that we do not want US conditions .
