M4M - Makefiles for Moses

Makefiles for Moses (M4M) is a collection of make file modules designed to
facilitate building and experimenting with Moses MT systems. The long story is
in the paper (m4m.pdf).

You'll need the following additional tools (in your PATH):
- wget if you want to use m4m to download and install WMT data sets 
- Gnu parallel: http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/
- a word aligner (mgiza or fastalign or Berkeley Aligner)

******************************************************************************
*        MAKEFILES FOR MOSES IS STILL UNDER INTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT.           *
*  BEAR WITH ME WHILE BUGS ARE BEING FIXED AND FUNCTIONALITY IS ADDED.       *
******************************************************************************

KNOWN ISSUES: 

- giza phrase table creation sometimes fails when make is run in
  multi-threaded mode. Running make without the -j switch seems to work.
