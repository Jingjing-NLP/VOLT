Open Machine Translation Core (OMTC)
====================================

OMTC is a proposed open standard for machine translation systems. This work has been done as part of the MosesCore FP7 project (http://www.statmt.org/mosescore/) and is released using the LGPL v3 license.

The OMTC Github repository contains the proposed standard documentation and a reference implemenation in Java. If you have any comments, or find any bugs please report to ian.johnson@capita-ti.com .


Initialise the OMTC submodule
-----------------------------

If you have not initialised the Git submodules, then return to the top level directory and issue the following command:

$ git submodule update --init --recursive

This shall clone *all* the submodules for the mosesdecoder project.

Returning to the OMTC clone using:

$ cd contrib/omtc/omtc

You'll find a documentation directory that contains the proposed standard and src directory which contains the reference implementation. The reference implementation can be built with Maven v2.2.1 (http://maven.apache.org/) or newer. Java v1.7 is required to build OMTC.
