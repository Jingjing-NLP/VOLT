This directory should contain all multi-purpose scripts for:

- training    ... training moses (including BLEU evaluation needed for MERT)
- analysis    ... analyzing MT output (for human analysis)
- generic     ... script for handling generic issues (parallelization)
- lib         ... perl modules used by various scripts


The Jamfile then takes care of proper 'release' from your git directory to
the shared directories.

The released scripts should remain in the *same directory structure*.
