==== Running the tests:

All *.test files here are run by ../Makefile.
Please do not run them from here, as they should depend some variables set by the ../Makefile

To run all tests, issue:
  make tests
  !! in the scripts directory

Ro tun a single test, issue:
  make tests/TESTNAME.test.run
  !! in the scripts directory

  Example:
  make tests/train-factored-test-step3.test.run



==== Building new tests

Each of the test should assume that it is launched in a fresh directory:

tests/TESTNAME.test.TIMESTAMP/

The test should prepare any files needed and then should test what there is to test.

The best way is to make a copy of an older test, rename, modify and add to the CVS.
