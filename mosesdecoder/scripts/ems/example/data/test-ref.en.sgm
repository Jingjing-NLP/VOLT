<seg id="1"> Illhaeusern... finally </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Illhaeusern has finally regained its path to victory on its own soil after a long period of draught. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Without playing a great match, the Yellow and Black have created the most occasions and managed to turn one of these into the match winner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The rhythm was not very steady during the match and the attackers found it hard to express themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> After a first attempt by the guest captain Kauffmann who narrowly missed the goal from a far shot, Illhaeusern went on to take a slight lead and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn from high, Romain with the tip of his foot or again Diebold came to tickle the Dannemarie defence. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At the front, there was a midfield block that allowed just the centre forward Riahi at the forefront of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The beginning of the second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, immediately after the score was opened for Illhaeuserns by Marais, well positioned to pick up a ball bounced off an initial attempt by Diebold (53'). </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the Illhaeusern striker did not enjoy his success for long and was forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later, leaving his team-mates numerically inferior. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But Dannemarie could not profit and could not cause any major problems to the Illhaeusern Eleven who just fell back a little to make its defence more "compact", except in the very last few seconds of the game where, after a big mess, the ball went very near the crosspiece. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Sarkozy meets angry fishermen. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is going to make a trip to Brittany. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Facing the display of force by the fishermen who on Monday had badly disturbed the access to several ports in Brittany and Normandy, on Tuesday morning at Guilvinec port, in Finistère, the president of the Republic has decided to yield and to meet their representatives. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The latter have promised to accept "with a constructive spirit" and they hope he "will arrive with practical proposals". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A presidential visit which occurs at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by fishermen in Brittany to come up with measures of addressing the soaring prices of oil, which peaked at an average of more than 1.14 Euro per litre. </seg>
<seg id="6"> According to the Elysée spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their enterprise to recover competitiveness and secure employment conditions and sailors' remuneration" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Nicolas Sarkozy is expected with determination by the fishermen. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On Tuesday morning, they conducted slow driving operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams for almost 10 km. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The leisure craft harbour of Quiberon was also blocked, but the roads to Belle-Isle were not blocked. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A filtering roadblock was set up on the Quiberon peninsula. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning, since dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the port of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The movement has spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and on the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained docked at the quayside or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any merchant ships. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Fishermen in La Turballe and Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique, in the evening stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery at Donges. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Those at Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait until after the meeting at the ministry on Wednesday to decide on possible actions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesday whether to comply with the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Committee of Fisheries, which did not support their movement. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" and "do not want to have to move onto Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Professional fishermen, who pay no taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but believe that the threshold of profitability for a vessel is achieved with diesel fuel prices less than 0.30 Euro per litre . </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The International American Insurance Group, that the U.S. monetary authorities have refloated, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion that were advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times. </seg>
<seg id="3"> AIG is ready to explore the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its pension business in the United States, said the newspaper quoting sources close to the case. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The administration board of AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible cessations, according to the FT. </seg>
<seg id="5"> No confirmation could be obtained from AIG. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The assets which AIG plans to cede include its leasing subsidiary Air International Lease Financial Corp., its participation of 59% in the reinsured Transatlantic Holdings, and its property portfolio in addition to its private equity investments, the FT added. </seg>
<seg id="7"> No final decision has been taken on these disposals, the FT continued. </seg>
<seg id="8"> AIG must quickly find the funds to repay the loan of 85 billion that it has with the Federal Reserve or else risk seeing the U.S. authorities take 80% of its shares, diluting the proportion due to current shareholders. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The New York Stock Exchange showed a historical fall on Monday after the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson plan to rescue the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen before approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10365.45 points. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Nasdaq index, mainly technological, has lost 199.61 points to 1983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (or 106.85 points) to 1106.55 points, according to final closing figures. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Already suffering a depression at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street went down after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the rescue plan for banks that was to inject some stability in the markets. </seg>
<seg id="7"> With 228 votes against and 205 for, the delegates have refused to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the resources he asked for. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan. </seg>
<seg id="9"> "This is a bad signal for the market, which saw the Congress failing to adopt a plan, "said Lindsey Piegża of FTN Financial. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, fearing that a draft adopted in several days time can be "too late". </seg>
<seg id="11"> "If the project is effectively dead (...) then the relay will be quickly passed to the Fed (i.e. the U.S. central bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis which would further tighten the credit conditions", predicted Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "each day that passes sees the fall of another financial institution" in the United States, emphasised Mrs Piegża. </seg>
<seg id="13"> After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities have organized the takeover of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions by banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets face "not only a crisis in U.S., but a global crisis", added the analyst from FTN Financial. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The bond market has climbed sharply. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Obama, who won on points the first televised duel </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> To the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has succeeded another to see who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Not surprisingly, the campaign headquarters of the Republicans and the Democrats have declared their own victory in the televised duel which was watched by a third of American families. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, though admirable, was not "brilliant" enough to enable it to reverse its decline in the polls five weeks from the presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Gallup, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives a five points lead to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that the Democrats have pulled their own on Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to a CBS poll, among the undecided voters, who are those that count, Obama has won 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give victory to McCain. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "It would be a mistake to underestimate her. </seg>
<seg id="9"> She has good instincts nonetheless", warned Bill Clinton this weekend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The septuagenarian McCain has repeatedly put forward his unquestionable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this initial face-to-face debate. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Senator Obama does not seem to understand that ..." he accused several times. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president," he also assured. </seg>
<seg id="13"> An angle of attack hammered yesterday in Republican television advertisements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Obama, himself, has stressed that he represented the future. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Without disassembling, he was concise and precise. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He put forward his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "McCain has never understood, while Obama, if", argued this weekend, a Democratic spot criticizing the Republican of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American on the streets". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "During the ninety-ten minute debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday to 20 000 people assembled for an electoral meeting in North Carolina in the pouring rain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He did not even utter the words "middle class" or "workers". "The financial crisis clearly gives an advantage to Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the brink of a precipice. </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The coming week could be a turning point", estimated yesterday the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an alumnus of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="22"> For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis "is the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policies implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain". </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Reaffirming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans despite the turmoil on Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also reported that the achievement of the country's energy independence by promoting renewable energy was his first priority, together with the establishment of a system of health insurance. </seg>
<seg id="24"> McCain, he wanted to build a cluster of 45 nuclear plants by 2030. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Cautious, both candidates have dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion Euro) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely unpopular. </seg>
