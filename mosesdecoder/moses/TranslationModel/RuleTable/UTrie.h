/** Implementation of RuleTableTrie.  A RuleTableUTrie is designed to store
 * string-to-tree SCFG grammars only (i.e. rules can have distinct labels on
 * the target side, but only a generic non-terminal on the source side).
 * A key is the source RHS (one symbol per edge) of a rule and a mapped value
 * is the collection of grammar rules that share the same source RHS.
 *
 * (The 'U' in UTrie stands for 'unlabelled' -- the keys are unlabelled and
 * the target labels are stored on the node values, as opposed to the grammar
 * being a monolingual projection with target labels projected onto the source
 * side.)
