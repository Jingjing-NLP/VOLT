 * Adds a vector of strings to Sentence that are filled from tab-separated input.
 * The first column is just treated as the normal input sentence with all the XML
 * processing and stuff. Then it contains a vector of strings that contains all
 * other columns.
 *
 * Aany feature function can do anything with any column. Ideally, feature
 * functions should keep the parse results for the columns in thread-specific
 * storage, e.g. boost::thread_specific_ptr<Something>.
 *
 * In theory a column can contain anything, even text-serialized parse trees or
 * classifier features as long it can be represented as text and does not contain
 * tab characters.
