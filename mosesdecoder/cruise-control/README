A simple regular testing of Moses codebase, aka cruise control
--------------------------------------------------------------

Features:

- Checkout latest commits
- Test configure, make, make scripts
- Run regression tests
- Run a sample EMS pipeline
- Report results into logfiles
- A simple web interface in PHP

How to run cruise control:

1) Download and compile SRILM

2) Download, compile and install IRSTLM

3) Edit the configuration file example.config. You can create as many
   configuration files as you like.

4) Execute ./test_all_new_commits.sh yourfile.config


How to set up the web interface:

1) Install Apache and PHP

2) Copy files from cruise-control/web into Apache's www directory

3) Point StaticData::logs_path to correct directory, e.g. /home/cruise/logs/example/
   Default value is 'data', you might want to just create a symlink.
