&quot; the potential productivity gains should be considerable .
today , QuarkXPress ® 8 has tighter integration with Photoshop ® and Illustrator ® than ever before , and through standards like HTML and CSS , QuarkXPress users can publish across media both independently and alongside Adobe ® Creative Suite ® applications like Adobe Flash ® ( SWF ) and Adobe Dreamweaver ® .
here , you &apos;ll find out how Creative Suite users can get the best possible interaction with QuarkXPress .
you &apos;ll be surprised how easy Quark has made it to unlock the full potential of all your design software .
QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop &apos;s PSD file format of any layout tool available today .
in this section we &apos;ll explain when you should use the PSD format for your images and how to get the most out of them .
for example , you may have multiple layers in your PSD with different product shots , which will vary from publication to publication .
if you use PSD , you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate TIFF for each publication .
another question that might tip you in favor of PSD is , &quot; Do I need to use a spot color with this image ?
&quot; using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated .
however , because of the way QuarkXPress supports PSD channels , it &apos;s simpler and more flexible .
bringing the PSD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image . create a Box and then use File &gt; Import ... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop , Finder or an application like Adobe Bridge ® with or without creating a box first .
to access the special features of PSD , open the PSD Import palette . ( window &gt; PSD Import ) You &apos;ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names .
for example , you &apos;ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . one option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level .
if you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . for example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image .
QuarkXPress can re ­ map any channel right in the PSD Import palette - non ­ destructively .
so click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project &apos;s color palette , ensuring consistency .
as powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can &apos;t manipulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g.
if you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won &apos;t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette .
if you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand @-@ alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; .
QuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls .
Illustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations .
traditionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator .
now , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 .
simply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format .
QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn &apos;t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet .
so if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non @-@ white background or object , you might see undesirable results .
the good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead .
QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator , Freehand and similar tools .
watch a video on how to create compelling illustrations in QuarkXPress 8 .
page @-@ layout professionals can create rich Flash projects - without compromising design - using the built @-@ in Flash authoring capabilities included in every edition of QuarkXPress 8 .
working in the same familiar print environment of QuarkXPress 8 , you can take existing print jobs to Flash , or create new Flash projects , in minutes - no additional purchase or coding required !

barbecue and Mate Tea are Argentinian inventions with a social function .
many Argentinian families have in their own grill in the backyard of their homes ( called parrillas ) , where they meet on the weekends for a meal together with friends and relatives .

the Sausage ( chorizo ) and the black pudding ( morcilla ) are very popular .
served with the meats are vegetables ( sweet potatoes , pumpkin puree ) and mixed salads .
in a restaurant it is of course possible to order other parts of meats .

special delicacies are : King prawns ( centolla ) from Tierra de Fuego and wild boar ( jabalí ) or trout in Bariloche .
special dishes , going back as far as colonial times are : &quot; pastel de choclo &quot; or the &quot; humita . &quot;
more typical are chicken &quot; pollo &quot; in its most varied prepartions , &quot; milanesa &quot; ( Viennese escalope ) , &quot; empanadas &quot; ( fried pastry shells filled with chopped beef , chicken , maize or cheese and ham ) or &quot; choripan &quot; similar to a Hot Dog .
many Italian restaurants are found here which serve pizza and pasta .
next to fresh fruit salads and good ice cream , a wide range of desserts are offered .
two Argentine specialities are the &quot; dulce de leche , &quot; milk @-@ caramel marmalade which is also used to as a bread spread and the &quot; alfajores &quot; ( small cake @-@ formed biscuits with different fillings ) .

this section holds the most general questions about PHP : what it is and what it does .
can I run several versions of PHP at the same time ?
what are the differences between PHP 3 and PHP 4 ?
what are the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5 ?
I think I found a bug ! who should I tell ?
much of its syntax is borrowed from C , Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP @-@ specific features thrown in .
the goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly .
this confuses many people because the first word of the acronym is the acronym .
this type of acronym is called a recursive acronym .
for more information , the curious can visit &quot; Free On @-@ Line Dictionary of Computing or the &quot; Wikipedia entry on recursive acronyms .
PHP / FI 2.0 is an early and no longer supported version of PHP .
PHP 3 is the successor to PHP / FI 2.0 and is a lot nicer .
PHP 5 is the current generation of PHP , which uses the &quot; Zend engine 2 which , among other things , offers many additional OOP features .
please see the &quot; What &apos;s new in PHP 4 overview for a detailed explanation of these features and more .
while PHP 5 was purposely designed to be as compatible as possible with previous versions , there are some significant changes .
for more detailed information , please view the section on Migrating from PHP 4 to PHP 5 and the section on Backwards Incompatible Changes .
you should go to the PHP Bug Database and make sure the bug isn &apos;t a known bug .
if you don &apos;t see it in the database , use the reporting form to report the bug .
it is important to use the bug database instead of just sending an email to one of the mailing lists because the bug will have a tracking number assigned and it will then be possible for you to go back later and check on the status of the bug .

note : note that JPC and JP2 are capable of having components with different bit depths .
in this case , the value for &quot; bits &quot; is the highest bit depth encountered .
also , JP2 files may contain multiple JPEG 2000 codestreams .
in this case , getimagesize ( ) returns the values for the first codestream it encounters in the root of the file .
note : the information about icons are retrieved from the icon with the highest bitrate .
it can reference a local file or ( configuration permitting ) a remote file using one of the supported streams .
this optional parameter allows you to extract some extended information from the image file .
currently , this will return the different JPG APP markers as an associative array .
some programs use these APP markers to embed text information in images .
a very common one is to embed &quot; IPTC information in the APP13 marker .
you can use the iptcparse ( ) function to parse the binary APP13 marker into something readable .
returns an array with 7 elements .
index 0 and 1 contains respectively the width and the height of the image .
note : some formats may contain no image or may contain multiple images .
in these cases , getimagesize ( ) might not be able to properly determine the image size. getimagesize ( ) will return zero for width and height in these cases .
index 2 is one of the IMAGETYPE _ XXX constants indicating the type of the image .
index 3 is a text string with the correct height = &quot; yyy &quot; width = &quot; xxx &quot; string that can be used directly in an IMG tag .
channels will be 3 for RGB pictures and 4 for CMYK pictures .

for the last few years the European Patent Office ( EPO ) has , contrary to the letter and spirit of the existing law , granted more than 30000 patents on rules of organisation and calculation claimed in terms of general @-@ purpose computing equipment , called &quot; programs for computers &quot; in the law of 1973 and &quot; computer @-@ implemented inventions &quot; in EPO Newspeak since 2000 .
Europe &apos;s patent movement is pressing to legitimate this practise by writing a new law .
although the patent movement has lost major battles in November 2000 and September 2003 , Europe &apos;s programmers and citizens are still facing considerable risks .
here you find the basic documentation , starting from the latest news and a short overview .
the patent movement has during several decades won the support of large corporations and governments for its expansionist cause .
yet FFII , Eurolinux and others have devoted themselves to this work with considerable success .
still , we continue to have more tasks than free hands .
here we tell you how you can help us move forward more quickly .

the FFII software patent workgroup is trying to single out the software patents , make them better accessible and show their effects on software development .
during the last few years , the European Patent Office ( EPO ) has granted several 10000 patents on computer @-@ implemented rules of organisation and calculation , i.e. programs for computers &#91; as such &#93; .
we are systematically collecting these patents and republishing them in a more accessible form .

it &apos;s the last month of the year ... time to look back on this year and time to embrace the new one .
for the Kindo team it was a very exciting one and we are busy working in the arms of the MyHeritage family .
you can read the announcement here ( pdf ) , or get the complete FAQ here , but I wanted to give you some more background on why Kindo and MyHeritage have teamed up .
the first time we met Gilad , the founder and CEO of Myheritage , was in early 2007 - a few weeks before we released the first public version of Kindo .
Gareth and me were invited to have lunch with him in Soho in central London , and went there with the objective of learning everything we could about the &quot; enemy . &quot;
this proved to be pretty naive , since Gilad is much too nice to be called an &quot; enemy . &quot;
but there we were : a Swede , a South African and an Israeli , all with very different professional background and life stories , talking about the future of families online from very different perspectives .
I didn &apos;t expect this , but we found that we had much in common .
we shared the same ideas and vision for what we wanted to achieve with our businesses , even though our approach was far from similar .
Kindo had set out to build a site that would help you interact with the family that is around you here and now .
we were trying to come up with tools to help you share information and communicate with the people that matter most to you right now .
MyHeritage on the other hand had developed amazing technologies to help you find out everything about your family &apos;s history , and had spent years perfecting these technologies .
ultimately though , what interested us both was the opportunity to help families discover more about who they are and their past , and use the web to bring them closer together .
as Gareth and I travelled back on the tube , we talked about how nice it would be to be able to offer our own users the same tools as MyHeritage already had .
what really got us excited was their SmartMatching Technology , which matches people in your family tree with 250 Million other names , and suggests who you might be related too .
during this summer , we &apos;ve been thinking long and hard about the future of Kindo , and what the best option would be for taking Kindo to the next level .
the more time we spent with Gilad as well as the rest of the team in Israel ( not to mention the very loud rooster that runs around in their campus ) , the more convinced we all became - we &apos;ll be better off together .
so we join the MyHeritage family because we share the same vision and values ( as families should ) , and because we think that we can build an amazing product together - bringing real benefits to families around the world .
this is what we &apos;re planning to do over the next years .
as you see from the smiles in the picture below , this is a happy day for us here in the Putney Offices .
this years Swedish Genealogy Days the yearly conference of the Swedish Federation of Genealogical Societies was held in the city of Malmö in the province of Skåne in southern Sweden .
over 100 exibitors crowded in the convention center at Europaporten in Malmö . everything from genealogical societies , archives to companies offering original sources online .
in the meanwhile , you can still work on your profiles and upload the photos from the weekend &apos;s family reunion .
update : now everything is fixed ! it was the database acting a bit weird but Stephen has done a great job to fix it .
everyone hits a brick wall in genealogy , where the birth and death records just aren &apos;t easy to find . in that case , try some different records .
deeds often contain information on who sold what to whom ; who inherited what from whom ; or how some land was divided among a family . historic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting information , such as co @-@ ownership .
just as the squirrels and different kinds of birds collect nuts and seeds , someone in the Kindo office seems to be doing some really solid forward planning .
judging from this picture - it &apos;s going to be a looong winter .
as I point out in my book , Genealogy Online 8th Edition , you can do a lot of good research using search engines and Boolean operators ( AND , NOT , OR , and parentheses . ) Recently , Yahoo !
advanced Google still accepts the most popular Boolean terms , and Exalead even supports the NEAR operator , which really helps with common surnames , but Live Search is now the only major search engine with full Boolean support .
for more details on how to do the Boolean Boogie for genealogy , read Genealogy Online 8th Edition .
most beginners to genealogy are fuzzy about cousinship . for example , while many understand first cousins are people with common grandparents , many folks confuse first cousin once removed and second cousin .
then , there are families like mine : my mother &apos;s siblings were born from 1911 to 1932 . that means her youngest brother &quot; Mike &quot; went to school with the oldest sister &apos;s oldest child , his niece &quot; Karen . &quot;
as it turned out , Uncle &quot; Mike &quot; and niece &quot; Karen &quot; married two people who were siblings , &quot; Michelle &quot; and &quot; Kevin , &quot; making their children both first cousins and first cousins once removed .
showing degrees of relationship by blood .
-first it does not replace paper documentation since it does not name common ancestors , it is more a tool to prove lineage .
several companies , like Family Tree DNA , can assist you to confirm your family tree or allow you to determine whether two people are related if you give them DNA of someone .
- It &apos;s less reffective for females to use DNA than for males because thanks to Y @-@ DNA , we can determine paternal and maternal lines , whereas for females it is just maternal .

following its acquisition of shares in 1926 in the German @-@ Russian &quot; Dereluft &quot; airline , which was founded in 1921 , Lufthansa is influential in the founding of the Spanish Iberia , the Brazilian &quot; Syndicato Condor &quot; and the Chinese &quot; Eurasia &quot; airlines .
Lufthansa opens the first trans @-@ oceanic , scheduled airmail service across the South Atlantic .
between 1936 and 1938 , it also experiments with scheduled air services across the North Atlantic .
after substantial expansion of the route network in 1939  including flights to Bangkok and Santiago de Chile  wartime air services , except for a few European countries , are suspended .
all flights are discontinued in 1945 and Lufthansa goes into receivership and is finally wound up and struck from the Berlin commercial register in 1965 .
the Federal Transport Minister sets up a working committee in 1951 to prepare for the resumption of air traffic in postwar Germany and entrusts the job of implementation to &quot; Büro Bongers , &quot; the office headed by Hans M. Bongers , the traffic chief of the old Lufthansa in Cologne . a new company to run air services and named &quot; Aktiengesellschaft für Luftverkehrsbedarf &quot; ( Luftag ) is founded in Cologne on January 6 , 1953 .
Lufthansa enters the jet age , initially on long @-@ haul routes , with the arrival in the fleet of the Boeing 707 .
the last of the propeller @-@ driven aircraft , a Vickers Viscount , is retired in 1971 .
conversion to jet aircraft continues with the start of flights on medium @-@ haul routes with the Boeing 727 and , on short @-@ haul , with the Boeing 737 , the city jet largely fathered by Lufthansa .
the wide @-@ body era begins at Lufthansa with the delivery of its first Boeing 747 jumbo jet in 1970 , later to be joined by the McDonnell @-@ Douglas DC10 and the A300 , the first of the jets from the newly founded European aircraftmaker .
Lufthansa resumes flights to Berlin 45 years after the end of World War Two following Germany &apos;s reunification .
Lufthansa masters its worst @-@ ever economic crisis with a sweeping rehabilitation programme .
the airline , largely owned by the state , is privatised step by step .
its MRO , cargo and IT businesses are spun off as independent companies .
Lufthansa , Air Canada , SAS , Thai Airways und United Airlines create the &quot; Star Alliance , &quot; the world &apos;s first multilateral airline grouping , later to be joined by other carriers .
the Lufthansa Aviation Group equips itself for the new millenium , training its focus on innovation and quality .
placement of orders for 15 Airbus A380 megaliners charts the airline &apos;s path into the future .
even during times of crisis in the aviation industry , Lufthansa remains on the ascent : with the &quot; Future European Operations &quot; programme , the airline reorganises its regional markets , while gaining new partner airlines to expand the Star Alliance global route network .
passengers enjoy greater comfort in a completely revamped Business Class with fast broadband Internet connectivity in the aircraft cabin .
Lufthansa creates new perspectives for Germany &apos;s future as a business location : Lufthansa orders 20 Boeing 747 @-@ 8s and is the launch customer for the aircraft .
preparations for the A380 include route proving with Airbus , a new A380 maintenance hangar and a new terminal area in Frankfurt .
the Lufthansa Aviation Center becomes an architectural flagship .
Lufthansa Cargo founds the cargo airline AeroLogic with DHL Express .
further partners strengthen the Star Alliance , which now encompasses 21 members .

there is finally an official answer to the question of whether or not WordPress themes must &quot; inherit &quot; the GPL license that WordPress itself uses .
Matt asked the Software Freedom Law Center to examine the WordPress source and how themes fit in . the final , official answer to whether themes must be GPL ?
the WordPress Plugin Competition is the best moment of the year , plugin wise .
this year &apos;s edition is still running till the end of the month of July and as of writing , there are about 10 plugins ( with some really interesting stuff ) . still , new plugins are released every day .
why aren &apos;t these authors joining the competition ? participating in the competition is Instructive : you * will * learn something .
if WordPress were a country , our Bill of Rights would be the GPL because it protects our core freedoms .
we &apos;ve always done our best to keep WordPress.org clean and only promote things that are completely compatible and legal with WordPress &quot; license .
there have been some questions in the community about whether the GPL applies to themes like we &apos;ve always assumed .
the Official WordPress Commercial Theme Directory is now open . it is linked off the WordPress Extend and is part of the parent theme directory set of links .
it is not as much a directory as it is a listing of sites that offer commercial GPL themes .
if you aren &apos;t already following along , I highly recommend checking out the How To Create A WordPress Theme tutorial series by Ian Stewart ( ThemeShaper.com ) .
this 12 @-@ part series ( 8 complete at the time of this writing ) aims to take you from nothing to a fully functional , semantically rich , flexible WordPress theme in digestible chunks .

a critical vulnerability has been discovered in the WordPress Plugin Related Sites plugin .

beta 2 is here . get it while it &apos;s ... still not quite out of Beta ... or something .
Dev4Press has done some interesting work on benchmarking various aspects of WordPress and then testing out some popular questions on page loads etc .
the methodologies are well documented and the benchmarking setup is standardized .
they are testing three version of WordPress including 2.6.5 , 2.7.1 and 2.8 ( I wish they would have waited for 2.8.1 to be released ) .

2.8.1 Beta 2 is ready for testing . download it , check out the changes since beta 1 , and review all tickets fixed in 2.8.1 .

one of the sites I &apos;m running is a long established community website with zillions of posts and bazillions of comments .
the whole stuff is powered by a home made CMS written in Perl , something I did nearly 10 years ago and that is totally outdated today .
it &apos;s not uncommon that a blog runs by different authors , so it may be useful if you can have a quick look at the drafts of all authors .
in our joint blog WP Engineer we created a feed , which keeps us up to date if a new draft of all authors were created . the work of every author is different and the dashboard is the center of information .
therefore we have decided to supplement a widget in the Dashboard , which shows the last five drafts of all authors . I enhanced the existing Plugin Draft Feed .

since so many people are having simple problems with their WordPress 2.8 installations , the WordPress community is working tirelessly to get a point @-@ one update out as soon as possible , and the first step on that road is to test a beta of the release .
WordPress 2.8.1 Beta 1 has been released , and they need people to test it out and see if it fixes the problems , so if you are having issues with WordPress 2.8 , try the beta , and see if that resolves it .
some plugins are causing grief for those upgrading to 2.8 . HyperDB needs to be updated to the latest version , otherwise tags won &apos;t save .
plugins that load old versions of jQuery for all admin pages will break all kinds of stuff . plugins should use the version of jQuery that ships with WP .

don � t miss out , read more about it here .
lottery remains for centuries one of the most common forms of gambling endorsed by governments worldwide .
the very first signs of this popular trend take us way back to the Han Dynasty in the Far East where a Lottery was used to aid in the finance of major governmental projects , targeted mainly to glorify the government and its people .
the game of Lottery is very strongly printed in today � s culture and even celebrated with splendor as we approach the holiday season .
the biggest celebration by far takes us to our neighboring Spain , where locals participate and enjoy Spain � s national Christmas lottery game known as � El Gordo � ( The Fat One ) , since 1812 .
as well as being one of the oldest lotteries around , the total prize pool in recent years , have surpassed the 2 billion Euro mark , making it also the biggest lottery worldwide ! !
with prizes being so high , more than 100 new millionaires are produced every Christmas .
� � El Gordo � works differently to most lottery games played , as countless people can share one single ticket .
a whole lottery ticket ( � billete � ) costs a few thousand Euros but these tickets are split to smaller sections , each costing around 20 Euros .
this means that many , even strangers , may share a whole ticket .
the idea is quite befitting especially now , in holiday season where many people in one community share a grand prize worth millions .
such an event can even affect the local economy .
the El Gordo takes place every 22nd of December and again on the 5th of January .
the whole drawing process takes at least three hours to complete , with the entire community tuned to the radio in suspense .
participation is also available through the internet , so now you don � t necessarily have to be in Spain in order to enter this grand lottery event .

the Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness .
his journeyings in the wilderness , and so forth .
Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty - His seed shall be scattered and smitten if they reject the Holy One of Israel - He exhorts his sons to put on the armor of righteousness .
1 And now it came to pass that after I , Nephi , had made an end of teaching my brethren , our a father , Lehi , also spake many things unto them , and rehearsed unto them , how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem .
2 And he spake unto them concerning their a rebellions upon the waters , and the mercies of God in sparing their lives , that they were not swallowed up in the sea .
3 And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise , which they had obtained - how a merciful the Lord had been in b warning us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem .
4 For , behold , said he , I have a seen a b vision , in which I know that c Jerusalem is d destroyed ; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have e perished .
5 But , said he , notwithstanding our afflictions , we have obtained a a land of promise , a land which is b choice above all other lands ; a land which the Lord God hath c covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed .
yea , the Lord hath d covenanted this land unto me , and to my children forever , and also all those who should be e led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord .
6 Wherefore , I , Lehi , prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me , that there shall a none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord .
7 Wherefore , this a land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring .
and if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given , it shall be a land of b liberty unto them ; wherefore , they shall never be brought down into captivity ; if so , it shall be because of iniquity ; for if iniquity shall abound c cursed shall be the land for their sakes , but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever .
8 And behold , it is wisdom that this land should be a kept as yet from the knowledge of other b nations ; for behold , many nations would overrun the land , that there would be no place for an inheritance .
9 Wherefore , I , Lehi , have obtained a a promise , that b inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments , they shall c prosper upon the face of this land ; and they shall be kept from all other nations , that they may possess this land unto themselves .
and if it so be that they shall d keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land , and there shall be none to molest them , nor to take away the land of their e inheritance ; and they shall dwell safely forever .
11 Yea , he will bring a other nations unto them , and he will give unto them power , and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions , and he will cause them to be b scattered and smitten .
12 Yea , as one generation passeth to another there shall be a bloodsheds , and great visitations among them ; wherefore , my sons , I would that ye would remember ; yea , I would that ye would hearken unto my words .
13 O that ye would awake ; awake from a deep a sleep , yea , even from the sleep of b hell , and shake off the awful c chains by which ye are bound , which are the chains which bind the children of men , that they are carried away captive down to the eternal d gulf of misery and woe .
and arise from the dust , and hear the words of a trembling a parent , whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent b grave , from whence no traveler can c return ; a few more d days and I go the e way of all the earth .
15 But behold , the Lord hath a redeemed my soul from hell ; I have beheld his b glory , and I am encircled about eternally in the c arms of his d love .
16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the a statutes and the judgments of the Lord ; behold , this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning .
18 Or , that a a cursing should come upon you for the space of b many generations ; and ye are visited by sword , and by famine , and are hated , and are led according to the will and captivity of the c devil .
19 O my sons , that these things might not come upon you , but that ye might be a choice and a a favored people of the Lord .
but behold , his will be done ; for his b ways are righteousness forever .
20 And he hath said that : a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my b commandments ye shall c prosper in the land ; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence .
22 That ye may not be a cursed with a sore cursing ; and also , that ye may not incur the displeasure of a b just God upon you , unto the destruction , yea , the eternal destruction of both soul and body .
23 Awake , my sons ; put on the armor of a righteousness .
shake off the b chains with which ye are bound , and come forth out of obscurity , and arise from the dust .
25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you , lest he shall suffer again ; for behold , ye have a accused him that he sought power and b authority over you ; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you , but he hath sought the glory of God , and your own eternal welfare .
26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you .
ye say that he hath used a sharpness ; ye say that he hath been angry with you ; but behold , his b sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God , which was in him ; and that which ye call anger was the truth , according to that which is in God , which he could not restrain , manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities .
27 And it must needs be that the a power of God must be with him , even unto his commanding you that ye must obey .
but behold , it was not he , but it was the b Spirit of the Lord which was in him , which c opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it .
28 And now my son , Laman , and also Lemuel and Sam , and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael , behold , if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish .
and if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a a blessing , yea , even my first blessing .
29 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my a first blessing , yea , even my blessing , and it shall rest upon him .
30 And now , Zoram , I speak unto you : behold , thou art the a servant of Laban ; nevertheless , thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem , and I know that thou art a true b friend unto my son , Nephi , forever .
31 Wherefore , because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed a with his seed , that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land ; and nothing , save it shall be iniquity among them , shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever .
32 Wherefore , if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord , the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son .
redemption cometh through the Holy Messiah - Freedom of choice ( agency ) is essential to existence and progression - Adam fell that men might be - Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life .
1 And now , Jacob , I speak unto you : thou art my a first -born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness .
and behold , in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow , because of the rudeness of thy brethren .
2 Nevertheless , Jacob , my first @-@ born in the wilderness , thou knowest the greatness of God ; and he shall consecrate thine a afflictions for thy gain .
3 Wherefore , thy soul shall be blessed , and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother , Nephi ; and thy days shall be a spent in the service of thy God .
Wherefore , I know that thou art redeemed , because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer ; for thou hast b beheld that in the c fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men .
4 And thou hast a beheld in thy youth his glory ; wherefore , thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh ; for the Spirit is the same , yesterday , today , and forever .
and the way is prepared from the fall of man , and b salvation is c free .
5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they a know good from evil .
and the b law is given unto men .
and by the law no flesh is c justified ; or , by the law men are d cut off .
yea , by the temporal law they were cut off ; and also , by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good , and become miserable forever .
6 Wherefore , a redemption cometh in and through the b Holy c Messiah ; for he is full of d grace and truth .
7 Behold , he offereth himself a a sacrifice for sin , to answer the ends of the law , unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit ; and unto b none else can the c ends of the law be answered .
9 Wherefore , he is the firstfruits unto God , inasmuch as he shall make a intercession for all the children of men ; and they that believe in him shall be saved .
10 And because of the intercession for a all , all men come unto God ; wherefore , they stand in the presence of him , to be b judged of him according to the truth and c holiness which is in him .
11 For it must needs be , that there is an a opposition in all things .
if not so , my first @-@ born in the wilderness , righteousness could not be brought to pass , neither wickedness , neither holiness nor misery , neither good nor bad .
Wherefore , all things must needs be a compound in one ; wherefore , if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead , having no life neither death , nor corruption nor incorruption , happiness nor misery , neither sense nor insensibility .
12 Wherefore , it must needs have been created for a thing of naught ; wherefore there would have been no a purpose in the end of its creation .
Wherefore , this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes , and also the power , and the mercy , and the b justice of God .
13 And if ye shall say there is a no law , ye shall also say there is no sin .
if ye shall say there is no sin , ye shall also say there is no righteousness .
and if there be no righteousness there be no happiness .
and if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery .
and if these things are not b there is no God .
and if there is no God we are not , neither the earth ; for there could have been no creation of things , neither to act nor to be acted upon ; wherefore , all things must have vanished away .
14 And now , my sons , I speak unto you these things for your profit and a learning ; for there is a God , and he hath b created all things , both the heavens and the earth , and all things that in them are , both things to act and things to be c acted upon .
16 Wherefore , the Lord God gave unto man that he should a act for himself .
Wherefore , man could not b act for himself save it should be that he was c enticed by the one or the other .
17 And I , Lehi , according to the things which I have read , must needs suppose that an a angel of God , according to that which is written , had b fallen from heaven ; wherefore , he became a c devil , having sought that which was evil before God .
18 And because he had fallen from heaven , and had become miserable forever , he a sought also the misery of all mankind .
Wherefore , he said unto Eve , yea , even that old serpent , who is the devil , who is the father of all b lies , wherefore he said : partake of the forbidden fruit , and ye shall not die , but ye shall be as God , c knowing good and evil .
19 And after Adam and Eve had a partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of b Eden , to till the earth .
20 And they have brought forth children ; yea , even the a family of all the earth .
21 And the days of the children of a men were prolonged , according to the b will of God , that they might c repent while in the flesh ; wherefore , their state became a state of d probation , and their time was lengthened , according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men .
for he gave commandment that all men must repent ; for he showed unto all men that they were e lost , because of the transgression of their parents .
22 And now , behold , if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen , but he would have remained in the garden of Eden .
and all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created ; and they must have remained forever , and had no end .
23 And they would have had no a children ; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence , having no b joy , for they knew no misery ; doing no good , for they knew no c sin .
24 But behold , all things have been done in the wisdom of him who a knoweth all things .
25 a Adam b fell that men might be ; and men c are , that they might have d joy .
26 And the a Messiah cometh in the fulness of time , that he may b redeem the children of men from the fall .
and because that they are c redeemed from the fall they have become d free forever , knowing good from evil ; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon , save it be by the punishment of the e law at the great and last day , according to the commandments which God hath given .
27 Wherefore , men are a free according to the b flesh ; and c all things are d given them which are expedient unto man .
and they are free to e choose f liberty and eternal g life , through the great Mediator of all men , or to choose captivity and death , according to the captivity and power of the devil ; for he seeketh that all men might be h miserable like unto himself .
29 And not choose eternal death , according to the will of the flesh and the a evil which is therein , which giveth the spirit of the devil power to b captivate , to bring you down to c hell , that he may reign over you in his own kingdom .
30 I have spoken these few words unto you all , my sons , in the last days of my probation ; and I have chosen the good part , according to the words of the prophet .
and I have none other object save it be the everlasting a welfare of your souls .
the Gods finish their planning of the creation of all things - They bring to pass the creation according to their plans - Adam names every living creature .
1 And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth , and all the a hosts of them .
2 And the Gods said among themselves : on the seventh time we will end our work , which we have counseled ; and we will a rest on the b seventh time from all our work which we have counseled .
3 And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time , because that on the seventh time they would a rest from all their b works which they ( the Gods ) counseled among themselves to form ; and c sanctified it .
and thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth .
5 According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of the field before it was in the a earth , and every herb of the field before it grew ; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they counseled to do them , and had not formed a man to till the ground .
6 But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .
7 And the a Gods formed man from the b dust of the ground , and took his c spirit ( that is , the man &apos;s spirit ) , and put it into him ; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life , and man became a living d soul .
8 And the Gods planted a garden , eastward in a Eden , and there they put the man , whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed .
9 And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food ; the a tree of life , also , in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .
10 There was a river running out of Eden , to water the garden , and from thence it was parted and became into four heads .
11 And the Gods took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden , to dress it and to keep it .
13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it ; for in the time that thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die .
now I , Abraham , saw that it was after the Lord &apos;s a time , which was after the time of b Kolob ; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning .
14 And the Gods said : let us make an help meet for the man , for it is not good that the man should be alone , therefore we will form an help meet for him .
16 And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man , formed they a a woman , and brought her unto the man .
18 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall a cleave unto his wife , and they shall be b one flesh .
19 And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not a ashamed .
20 And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air , and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them ; and whatsoever a Adam called every living creature , that should be the name thereof .
21 And Adam gave a names to all b cattle , to the fowl of the air , to every beast of the field ; and for Adam , there was found an c help meet for him .
men are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works - They are to teach the commandments - Through righteousness they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the Lord - Melchizedek was one of these - Angels are declaring glad tidings throughout the land - They will reveal the actual coming of Christ .
1 And again , my brethren , I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children ; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God a ordained priests , after his holy order , which was after the order of his Son , to teach these things unto the people .
2 And those priests were ordained after the a order of his Son , in a b manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption .
4 And thus they have been a called to this holy calling on account of their faith , while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and b blindness of their minds , while , if it had not been for this they might have had as great c privilege as their brethren .
9 Thus they become a high priests forever , after the order of the Son , the Only Begotten of the Father , who is without beginning of days or end of years , who is full of b grace , equity , and truth .
11 Therefore they were called after this holy order , and were a sanctified , and their b garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb .
12 Now they , after being a sanctified by the b Holy Ghost , having their garments made white , being c pure and spotless before God , could not look upon d sin save it were with e abhorrence ; and there were many , exceedingly great many , who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God .
13 And now , my brethren , I would that ye should humble yourselves before God , and bring forth a fruit meet for repentance , that ye may also enter into that rest .
14 Yea , humble yourselves even as the people in the days of a Melchizedek , who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken , who also took upon him the high priesthood forever .
15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid a tithes ; yea , even our father Abraham paid tithes of one @-@ tenth part of all he possessed .
16 Now these a ordinances were given after this b manner , that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God , it being a c type of his order , or it being his order , and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins , that they might enter into the rest of the Lord .
18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith , and received the office of the high priesthood according to the a holy order of God , did preach repentance unto his people .
and behold , they did repent ; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days ; therefore he was called the prince of peace , for he was the king of Salem ; and he did reign under his father .
19 Now , there were a many before him , and also there were many afterwards , but b none were greater ; therefore , of him they have more particularly made mention .
20 Now I need not rehearse the matter ; what I have said may suffice .
behold , the a scriptures are before you ; if ye will b wrest them it shall be to your own destruction .
22 Yea , and the voice of the Lord , by the a mouth of angels , doth declare it unto all nations ; yea , doth declare it , that they may have glad tidings of great joy ; yea , and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people , yea , even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth ; wherefore they have come unto us .
23 And they are made known unto us in a plain terms , that we may understand , that we cannot err ; and this because of our being b wanderers in a strange land ; therefore , we are thus highly favored , for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard .
24 For behold , a angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land ; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory .
25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels , of his coming ; for the time cometh , we a know not how soon .
would to God that it might be in my day ; but let it be sooner or later , in it I will rejoice .
26 And it shall be made known unto a just and holy men , by the mouth of angels , at the time of his coming , that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled , according to that which they have spoken concerning him , which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them .
29 a Having faith on the Lord ; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life ; having the b love of God always in your hearts , that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his c rest .
30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance , that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you , that ye may not be a bound down by the chains of b hell , that ye may not suffer the second c death .
31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people , which are not written in a this book .
revelation given through Joseph Smith , at Manchester , New York , March 1830 . HC 1 : 72 @-@ 74 .
1 @-@ 3 , Christ has all power ; 4 @-@ 5 , All men must repent or suffer ; 6 @-@ 12 , Eternal punishment is God &apos;s punishment ; 13 @-@ 20 , Christ suffered for all , that they might not suffer if they would repent ; 21 @-@ 28 , Preach the gospel of repentance ; 29 @-@ 41 , Declare glad tidings .
1 I am a Alpha and Omega , b Christ the Lord ; yea , even I am he , the beginning and the end , the Redeemer of the c world .
3 Retaining all a power , even to the b destroying of Satan and his works at the c end of the world , and the last great day of judgment , which I shall pass upon the inhabitants thereof , d judging every man according to his e works and the deeds which he hath done .
4 And surely every man must a repent or b suffer , for I , God , am c endless .
5 Wherefore , I a revoke not the judgments which I shall pass , but woes shall go forth , weeping , b wailing and gnashing of teeth , yea , to those who are found on my c left hand .
6 Nevertheless , it is a not written that there shall be no end to this torment , but it is written b endless c torment .
7 Again , it is written a eternal damnation ; wherefore it is more express than other scriptures , that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men , altogether for my name &apos;s glory .
8 Wherefore , I will explain unto you this a mystery , for it is meet unto you to know even as mine apostles .
9 I speak unto you that are chosen in this thing , even as one , that you may enter into my a rest .
10 For , behold , the a mystery of godliness , how great is it !
for , behold , I am b endless , and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless c punishment , for d Endless is my name .
11 a Eternal punishment is God &apos;s punishment .
15 Therefore I command you to repent - repent , lest I a smite you by the rod of my mouth , and by my wrath , and by my anger , and your b sufferings be sore - how sore you know not , how exquisite you know not , yea , how hard to bear you know not .
19 Nevertheless , glory be to the Father , and I partook and a finished my preparations unto the children of men .
20 Wherefore , I command you again to repent , lest I a humble you with my almighty power ; and that you b confess your sins , lest you suffer these c punishments of which I have spoken , of which in the smallest , yea , even in the least degree you have d tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit .
21 And I command you that you a preach naught but repentance , and show b not these things unto the world until it is wisdom in me .
22 For they cannot a bear meat now , but b milk they must receive ; wherefore , they must not know these things , lest they perish .
23 a Learn of me , and listen to my words ; b walk in the c meekness of my Spirit , and you shall have d peace in me .
24 I am Jesus Christ ; I a came by the b will of the Father , and I do his will .
25 And again , I command thee that thou shalt not a covet thy b neighbor &quot; s c wife ; nor seek thy neighbor &apos;s life .
27 Which is my word to the a Gentile , that soon it may go to the b Jew , of whom the Lamanites are a c remnant , that they may believe the gospel , and look not for a d Messiah to come who has already come .
28 And again , I command thee that thou shalt a pray b vocally as well as in thy heart ; yea , before the world as well as in secret , in public as well as in private .
29 And thou shalt a declare glad tidings , yea , b publish it upon the mountains , and upon every high place , and among every people that thou shalt be permitted to see .
30 And thou shalt do it with all humility , a trusting in me , b reviling not against revilers .
31 And of a tenets thou shalt not talk , but thou shalt declare repentance and b faith on the Savior , and c remission of sins by d baptism , and by e fire , yea , even the f Holy Ghost .
32 Behold , this is a great and the last a commandment which I shall give unto you concerning this matter ; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk , even unto the end of thy life .
33 And misery thou shalt receive if thou wilt slight these a counsels , yea , even the destruction of thyself and property .
34 a Impart a portion of thy property , yea , even part of thy lands , and all save the support of thy b family .
35 Pay the a debt thou hast b contracted with the printer .
release thyself from c bondage .
37 And a speak freely to all ; yea , preach , exhort , declare the b truth , even with a loud voice , with a sound of rejoicing , crying - Hosanna , hosanna , blessed be the name of the Lord God !
38 a Pray always , and I will b pour out my Spirit upon you , and great shall be your blessing - yea , even more than if you should obtain c treasures of earth and corruptibleness to the extent thereof .
39 Behold , canst thou read this without a rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for b gladness ?
40 Or canst thou run about longer as a a blind guide ?
41 Or canst thou be a humble and meek , and conduct thyself wisely before me ?
revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon , at or near Fayette , New York , December 1830 . HC 1 : 128 @-@ 131 .
at this time the Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a translation of the Bible .
the translation was begun as early as June 1830 , and both Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer had served as scribes .
since they had now been called to other duties , Sidney Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as the Prophet &apos;s scribe in this work ( verse 20 ) .
as a preface to his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote : &quot; in December Sidney Rigdon came &#91; from Ohio &#93; to inquire of the Lord , and with him came Edward Partridge . .
1 Listen to the voice of the a Lord your God , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , whose c course is one d eternal round , the e same today as yesterday , and forever .
2 I am Jesus Christ , the Son of God , who was a crucified for the sins of the world , even as many as will b believe on my name , that they may become the c sons of God , even d one in e me as I am f one in the Father , as the Father is one in me , that we may be one .
3 Behold , verily , verily , I say unto my servant Sidney , I have looked upon thee and thy works .
I have a heard thy prayers , and prepared thee for a greater work .
4 Thou art blessed , for thou shalt do great things .
behold thou wast sent forth , even as a John , to prepare the way before me , and before b Elijah which should come , and thou knewest it not .
6 But now I give unto thee a commandment , that thou shalt a baptize by water , and they shall receive the b Holy Ghost by the laying on of the c hands , even as the apostles of old .
7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land , even among the a Gentiles , for their b folly and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people .
8 For I am God , and mine arm is not a shortened ; and I will show b miracles , c signs , and wonders , unto all those who d believe on my name .
9 And whoso shall ask it in my name in a faith , they shall b cast out c devils ; they shall heal the d sick ; they shall cause the blind to receive their e sight , and the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak , and the lame to walk .
11 But a without faith shall not anything be shown forth except b desolations upon c Babylon , the same which has made d all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her e fornication .
12 And there are a none that doeth good except those who are ready to b receive the fulness of my gospel , which I have sent forth unto this generation .
14 And their arm shall be my arm , and I will be their a shield and their buckler ; and I will gird up their loins , and they shall fight manfully for me ; and their b enemies shall be under their feet ; and I will let c fall the d sword in their behalf , and by the e fire of mine indignation will I preserve them .
16 And they shall learn the parable of the a fig -tree , for even now already summer is nigh .
18 And I have given unto him the a keys of the mystery of those things which have been b sealed , even things which were from the c foundation of the world , and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming , if he d abide in me , and if not , e another will I plant in his stead .
19 Wherefore , watch over him that his faith fail not , and it shall be given by the a Comforter , the b Holy Ghost , that knoweth all things .
21 For they will hear my a voice , and shall b see me , and shall not be c asleep , and shall d abide the day of my e coming ; for they shall be f purified , even as I am pure .
22 And now I say unto you , a tarry with him , and he shall journey with you ; forsake him not , and surely these things shall be fulfilled .
23 And a inasmuch as ye do not write , behold , it shall be b given unto him to prophesy ; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on c the holy prophets to prove his words , as they shall be given him .
25 And a Israel shall be b saved in mine own due time ; and by the c keys which I have given shall they be led , and no more be confounded at all .
26 a Lift up your hearts and be glad , your b redemption draweth nigh .
27 Fear not , little a flock , the b kingdom is yours until I come .
revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , on the bank of the Missouri River , McIlwaine &apos;s Bend , August 12 , 1831 . HC 1 : 202 @-@ 205 .
on their return trip to Kirtland the Prophet and ten elders had traveled down the Missouri River in canoes .
on the third day of the journey many dangers were experienced .
elder William W. Phelps , in daylight vision , saw the destroyer riding in power upon the face of the waters .
1 @-@ 12 , The Lord has decreed many destructions upon the waters ; 13 @-@ 22 , The waters were cursed by John , and the destroyer rideth upon their face ; 23 @-@ 29 , Some have power to command the waters ; 30 @-@ 35 , Elders are to journey two by two and preach the gospel ; 36 @-@ 39 , They are to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man .
1 Behold , and hearken unto the voice of him who has all a power , who is from everlasting to everlasting , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end .
3 But verily I say unto you , that it is not needful for this whole company of mine elders to be moving swiftly upon the waters , whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief .
5 For I , the Lord , have decreed in mine anger many destructions upon the waters ; yea , and especially upon these waters .
6 Nevertheless , all flesh is in mine hand , and he that is faithful among you shall not a perish by the waters .
7 Wherefore , it is expedient that my servant Sidney Gilbert and my servant a William W. Phelps be in haste upon their errand and mission .
9 But now , verily I say , it behooveth me that ye should part .
10 And inasmuch as they are a faithful they shall be preserved , and I , the Lord , will be b with them .
11 And let the residue take that which is needful for clothing .
12 Let my servant Sidney Gilbert take that which is not needful with him , as you shall agree .
13 And now , behold , for your a good I gave unto you a b commandment concerning these things ; and I , the Lord , will reason with you as with men in days of old .
14 Behold , I , the Lord , in the beginning blessed the a waters ; but in the last days , by the mouth of my servant John , I b cursed the waters .
15 Wherefore , the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters .
16 And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the land of Zion upon the waters , but he that is upright in heart .
17 And , as I , the Lord , in the beginning a cursed the land , even so in the last days have I b blessed it , in its time , for the use of my saints , that they may partake the fatness thereof .
